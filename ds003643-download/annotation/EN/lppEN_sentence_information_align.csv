once when i was six years old i saw a magnificent picture in a book about the primeval forest called real life stories,0.113,8.339,8.226
it showed a boa constrictor swallowing a wild animal,9.247,12.416,3.1690000000000005
here is a copy of the drawing,13.144,14.464,1.3200000000000003
it said in the book boa constrictors swallow their prey whole without chewing then they are not able to move and they sleep for the six months it takes for digestion,15.86,26.339,10.479
so i thought a lot about the adventures of the jungle and in turn i managed with a colored pencil to make my first drawing my drawing number one,27.292,36.647,9.354999999999997
it looked like this,37.186,38.326,1.1400000000000006
i showed my masterpiece to the grownups and i asked them if my drawing frightened them,39.608,44.011,4.403000000000006
they answered me why would anyone be frightened by a hat,44.39,48.092,3.701999999999998
my drawing was not of a hat,49.13,50.645,1.5150000000000006
it showed a boa constrictor digesting an elephant,51.109,54.232,3.1229999999999976
i then drew the inside of the boa constrictor so that the grownups could understand,55.085,60.093,5.008000000000003
they always need to have things explained,60.612,62.676,2.064
my drawing number two looked like this,63.594,65.973,2.378999999999998
the grownups advised me to leave aside drawings of boa constrictors open or closed and to apply myself instead to geography history arithmetic and grammar,67.14,77.391,10.251000000000005
thus i abandoned at the age of six a magnificent career as a painter,78.25399999999999,83.17299999999999,4.918999999999997
i was discouraged by the failure of my drawing number one and of my drawing number two,83.71600000000001,88.61,4.893999999999991
grownups never understand anything by themselves and it is tiresome for children to always explain things for them again and again,89.054,96.912,7.858000000000004
so i had to choose another profession and i learned to fly airplanes,97.465,101.374,3.908999999999992
i flew a little in many places around the world and geography it is true has served me well,102.267,107.53,5.263000000000005
i could recognize at first glance china from arizona,108.174,111.568,3.3939999999999912
it is very useful if you get lost at night,111.893,114.057,2.1640000000000015
i have had during my life a lot of contact with many persons of consequence,114.725,119.733,5.00800000000001
i have lived a lot amongst the grownups,120.152,122.806,2.6539999999999964
i have seen them from close up,123.19,124.67,1.480000000000004
it has not much improved my opinion of them,125.363,127.528,2.1650000000000063
whenever i met one of them that seemed a bit more clear sighted i tried the experiment of showing them my drawing number one that i have always kept,128.361,136.958,8.597000000000008
i wanted to know if they were really a person of true understanding but they always responded it is a hat,137.526,144.08700000000002,6.561000000000007
so i would never speak to them of boa constrictors nor of primeval forests nor of the stars,145.045,150.833,5.788000000000011
i put myself at their level,151.531,153.056,1.5250000000000057
i talked to them about bridge golf politics and neckties and the grownup was glad to know such a sensible man,153.44,161.889,8.449000000000012
so i lived alone without anyone i could really talk to until a breakdown in the sahara desert six years ago,163.261,170.017,6.756
something had broken in my engine and as i had with me neither a mechanic nor any passengers i readied myself to try and carry out all alone the difficult repairs,170.856,181.221,10.365000000000009
for me it was a matter of life or death,182.039,184.092,2.0530000000000257
i had hardly enough water to drink for a week,184.611,187.0,2.38900000000001
the first night i went to sleep on the sand a thousand miles from any human habitation,188.148,193.171,5.022999999999996
i was more isolated than a shipwrecked sailor on a raft in the middle of the ocean,193.62,198.164,4.543999999999983
so you can imagine my surprise when at daybreak a funny little voice woke me up,198.772,203.985,5.213000000000022
it said please draw me a sheep,204.758,208.065,3.306999999999988
what,208.623,209.028,0.40500000000000114
draw me a sheep,209.901,210.981,1.079999999999984
i jumped to my feet as if i had been struck by lightning,212.008,214.702,2.6939999999999884
i rubbed my eyes,215.037,216.081,1.0439999999999827
i took a good look around me and i saw a quite extraordinary little man who was examining me seriously,216.66,223.907,7.247000000000014
here is the best portrait that later i managed to do of him but my drawing of course is much less charming than its model,224.735,232.081,7.345999999999975
it is not my fault,232.549,233.399,0.8499999999999943
i was discouraged in my career as a painter by the grownups at the age of six and i had not learned to draw anything except boa constrictors closed and open,233.803,242.21400000000003,8.41100000000003
i stared at this sudden apparition wide eyed with astonishment,243.227,247.125,3.897999999999996
remember that i was a thousand miles from any inhabited region and yet this little fellow seemed neither lost nor half dead with fatigue nor starved or dying of thirst or fear,247.34,258.43,11.090000000000003
he looked nothing like a child lost in the middle of the desert a thousand miles from any inhabited region,259.448,265.456,6.008000000000038
when i finally managed to speak i said what are you doing here,266.399,270.616,4.2169999999999845
and he repeated very slowly as if it was something very serious please draw me a sheep,271.279,279.089,7.810000000000002
when a mystery is too overpowering one dare not disobey,280.615,284.14,3.5249999999999773
absurd as it seemed to me a thousand miles from any human habitation and in danger of death i took out of my pocket a sheet of paper and a pen,284.813,293.80400000000003,8.991000000000042
but then i remembered that i had mainly studied geography history arithmetic and grammar and i told the little fellow a little crossly that i did not know how to draw,294.408,304.697,10.288999999999987
he replied it does not matter,305.48,307.509,2.0289999999999964
draw me a sheep,307.967,308.97700000000003,1.0100000000000477
as i had never drawn a sheep i redrew for him one of the only two drawings that i was capable of,310.095,315.538,5.442999999999984
the one of the closed boa constrictor,316.011,318.131,2.1199999999999477
and i was astounded to hear the little fellow respond no no i do not want an elephant inside a boa constrictor,318.649,326.565,7.915999999999997
a boa constrictor is very dangerous and an elephant is very cumbersome,326.939,331.712,4.772999999999968
where i live everything is very small,332.126,334.326,2.2000000000000455
i need a sheep,334.675,335.825,1.1499999999999773
draw me a sheep,336.10400000000004,337.069,0.964999999999975
so i drew,337.927,338.596,0.6689999999999827
he looked carefully then said no this one is already very sick,339.584,344.112,4.52800000000002
make another one,344.436,345.326,0.8900000000000432
i drew again,346.069,346.899,0.8299999999999841
my friend smiled gently and indulgently you can see yourself,347.62699999999995,352.275,4.648000000000025
this is not a sheep,352.275,353.395,1.1200000000000045
it is a ram,353.395,354.345,0.9500000000000455
it has horns,354.67900000000003,355.949,1.2699999999999818
so once again i redid my drawing,356.911,359.081,2.170000000000016
but it was rejected like the previous ones,359.37,361.869,2.4990000000000236
this one is too old,362.562,364.537,1.974999999999966
i want a sheep that will live a long time,364.537,367.036,2.4990000000000236
so getting impatient as i was eager to start dismantling my engine i hastily sketched this drawing and i snapped this,368.008,376.513,8.504999999999995
here is the box,376.513,377.473,0.9600000000000364
the sheep you want is inside,377.473,379.032,1.558999999999969
but i was very surprised to see the face of my young judge light up,379.761,383.985,4.2239999999999895
it is exactly the way i wanted,384.6880000000001,386.692,2.0039999999999054
do you think this sheep needs a lot of grass,387.091,389.416,2.3249999999999886
why,390.164,390.614,0.44999999999998863
because where i am from everything is very small,391.317,393.857,2.5400000000000205
there will certainly be enough,394.645,395.905,1.259999999999991
i gave you a very small sheep,396.154,398.153,1.9990000000000236
he leaned his head towards the drawing,399.111,401.076,1.9650000000000318
not that small,401.629,402.784,1.1549999999999727
look,403.407,403.967,0.5600000000000023
he is fallen asleep,404.306,405.515,1.2090000000000032
and that is how i met the little prince,406.348,408.467,2.1189999999999714
it took me a long time to find out where he came from,410.046,412.93,2.8840000000000146
the little prince who asked me many questions never seemed to hear my own,413.454,417.972,4.517999999999972
it was the words spoken by chance that little by little revealed everything to me,419.004,423.648,4.6440000000000055
so when he saw my airplane for the first time,424.491,426.785,2.2940000000000396
i will not draw my airplane,427.384,428.889,1.5049999999999955
it would be a drawing far too complicated for me,428.889,431.392,2.502999999999986
he asked me what is that thing there,431.881,434.449,2.5680000000000405
it is not a thing,435.297,436.062,0.7649999999999864
it flies,436.261,436.956,0.6949999999999932
it is an airplane,437.156,437.965,0.8089999999999691
it is my airplane,438.057,438.905,0.8479999999999563
and i was proud to have him know that i could fly,439.608,441.947,2.3389999999999986
then he cried what you fell from the sky,442.82,446.143,3.322999999999979
yes i said modestly,446.821,448.386,1.5649999999999977
oh that is funny,448.999,450.559,1.5600000000000023
and the little prince broke into a lovely peal of laughter which irritated me very much,451.302,456.82,5.517999999999972
i prefer people to take my misfortunes seriously,457.403,460.172,2.7690000000000055
then he added so you also come from the sky,460.691,463.935,3.244000000000028
what planet are you from,464.503,465.67800000000005,1.1750000000000682
i caught a glimpse into the mystery of his presence and i asked abruptly so you come from another planet then,467.045,473.321,6.2760000000000105
but he did not answer,474.124,475.064,0.9399999999999977
he shook his head slowly whilst looking at my airplane,475.753,478.527,2.774000000000001
it is true that you can not have come from far away in that and he drifted into a daydream which lasted a long while,479.415,486.701,7.286000000000001
then taking my sheep out of his pocket he sank himself into the contemplation of his treasure,487.469,492.672,5.203000000000031
you can imagine how my curiosity was aroused by this small disclosure about the other planets so i tried to find out more,493.341,501.342,8.000999999999976
where are you from my little fellow,502.34,503.944,1.6040000000000418
where is this where i live of yours,504.628,506.952,2.3240000000000123
where do you take my sheep off to,507.396,509.046,1.6499999999999773
after a reflective silence he answered what is good about the box you have given is that at night he can use it as a house,510.432,518.352,7.919999999999959
that is right and if you are good i will give you a rope to tie him up with during the day and a stake,519.061,524.567,5.505999999999972
the offer seemed to shock the little prince,525.549,527.509,1.9600000000000364
tie him up,527.988,528.762,0.7739999999998872
what a funny idea,529.316,530.566,1.25
but if you do not tie him up he will wander off and get lost,531.3290000000001,534.118,2.7889999999999873
my friend broke into another peal of laughter,535.106,537.585,2.479000000000042
where do you think he would go,538.239,539.878,1.63900000000001
anywhere straight ahead,540.467,542.056,1.5890000000000555
then the little prince said gravely that does not matter,542.979,546.366,3.3869999999999436
where i live everything is so small,546.955,549.04,2.0849999999999227
and perhaps with a hint of sadness he added straight ahead you can not go far,549.908,554.63,4.72199999999998
i thus learned a second very important thing that his home planet was barely bigger than a house,555.006,561.603,6.59699999999998
it did not surprise me much,562.301,563.93,1.6289999999999054
i knew that apart from the large planets like the earth jupiter mars and venus which have been given names there are hundreds of others that are sometimes so small that one has great difficulty in spotting them through the telescope,564.244,577.533,13.288999999999987
when an astronomer discovers one of these he gives it a number for a name,578.456,582.55,4.093999999999937
he might call it for example asteroid 325,583.168,586.727,3.558999999999969
i have serious reason to believe that the planet from where the little prince came is the asteroid b 612,587.899,595.01,7.11099999999999
this asteroid has only been seen through a telescope once in 1909 by a turkish astronomer,595.584,601.617,6.0330000000000155
he had then given a big presentation on his discovery at an international astronomy conference but nobody had believed him because of his outfit,602.41,610.966,8.55600000000004
grownups are like that,611.415,612.529,1.1140000000000327
fortunately for the reputation of asteroid b 612 a turkish dictator imposed on his people on pain of death to dress themselves in the european fashion,613.377,623.687,10.31000000000006
the astronomer gave his presentation again in 1920 dressed very stylishly and this time everybody believed him,624.53,631.937,7.407000000000039
if i have told you these details about the asteroid b 612 and revealed to you its number it is because of the grownups,633.174,640.136,6.961999999999989
grownups love numbers,640.6,641.884,1.2839999999999918
when you talk to them about a friend they never ask you about any of the important things,642.318,646.621,4.302999999999997
they never ask you how does his voice sound,646.96,649.469,2.5090000000000146
what games does he like best,649.703,651.302,1.5990000000000464
does he collect butterflies,651.577,652.946,1.3690000000000282
they ask how old is he,653.56,655.039,1.4790000000000418
how many brothers does he have,655.428,656.658,1.2300000000000182
how much does he weigh,656.8969999999999,657.832,0.9350000000000591
how much money does his father make,658.261,659.801,1.5400000000000773
only then do they think they know him,660.434,662.494,2.060000000000059
if you said to the grownups i saw a beautiful red brick house with geraniums by the windows and doves on the roof they would not be able to picture this house in their minds,663.401,673.941,10.540000000000077
you would have to tell them i saw a hundred thousand franc house and they would cry how pretty,674.245,680.53,6.284999999999968
so if you were to say to them the proof that the little prince existed is that he was charming,681.428,686.63,5.201999999999998
he laughed and he wanted a sheep,686.8489999999999,688.5889999999999,1.740000000000009
if someone wants a sheep that proves they exist,689.1379999999999,692.071,2.9330000000001064
they would shrug their shoulders and treat you like a child,692.54,695.329,2.7889999999999873
but if you were to say the planet he came from is the asteroid b 612 they would be convinced and leave you in peace and spare you their questions,695.918,705.119,9.201000000000022
they are like that,705.543,706.297,0.7540000000000191
do not blame them,706.492,707.207,0.7150000000000318
children should be forgiving towards the grownups,707.755,710.039,2.283999999999992
but of course those of us who understand life we do not much care for numbers,710.633,715.491,4.857999999999947
i would have liked to begin this story in the same way as a fairy tale,716.179,719.3779999999999,3.1989999999999554
i would have liked to say once upon a time there was a little prince who lived on a planet not much bigger than himself and who needed a friend,719.887,727.543,7.656000000000063
for those who understand life it would have seemed much more natural,728.1959999999999,732.165,3.969000000000051
for i do not want my book to be read lightly,732.718,734.917,2.199000000000069
i feel so much sadness in recounting these memories,735.486,738.34,2.854000000000042
it is already been six years since my friend left with his sheep,738.739,742.248,3.5090000000000146
if i try to describe him here it is so as not to forget him,743.126,746.505,3.379000000000019
it is sad to forget a friend,747.178,748.548,1.3700000000000045
not everyone has had a friend and if i forgot him i could become like the grownups who are only interested in numbers,749.136,756.492,7.3559999999999945
so that is why i have again bought a box of paints and some pencils,757.395,761.294,3.899000000000001
it is hard to take up drawing again at my age when i have only ever attempted to draw a boa constrictor closed and open at the age of six,761.982,769.663,7.68100000000004
i will try of course to make my portraits as lifelike as possible but i am not quite sure i will succeed,770.396,776.413,6.017000000000053
some drawings go alright,777.071,778.496,1.4249999999999545
others do not look like their subjects,778.975,780.789,1.8139999999999645
i also get the size a bit wrong,781.627,783.561,1.9340000000000828
here the little prince is too big,784.29,786.004,1.7140000000000555
there he is too small,786.298,787.553,1.2549999999999955
i am also not sure about the color of his outfit so i fumble along somehow as best i can,788.361,794.338,5.976999999999975
i will make mistakes on certain important points too but you will have to forgive me that my friend never gave explanations,795.027,802.617,7.589999999999918
perhaps he thought i was just like himself but i unfortunately do not know how to see sheep through boxes,803.121,809.5319999999999,6.4109999999999445
perhaps i am a bit like the grownups,810.1610000000001,811.8399999999999,1.67899999999986
i must have got older,812.423,813.5029999999999,1.0799999999999272
every day i would learn something about his planet the departure and the trip,814.825,818.8679999999999,4.042999999999893
the information came slowly as his thoughts wandered,819.706,822.611,2.9049999999999727
it was in this way that on the third day i came to know of the tragedy of the baobabs,823.434,828.627,5.192999999999984
this time again it was thanks to the sheep because the little prince asked me abruptly as if seized by a grave doubt,829.345,836.4159999999999,7.070999999999913
it is true is not it that sheep eat shrubs,837.264,840.2529999999999,2.988999999999919
yes it is true,840.892,841.956,1.0639999999999645
oh i am glad,842.704,843.5740000000001,0.8700000000001182
i did not understand why it was so important that sheep eat shrubs but the little prince added then it follows they also eat baobabs,844.467,852.937,8.470000000000027
i pointed out to the little prince that baobabs were not shrubs but trees as big as churches and that even if he took with him a whole herd of elephants the herd would not manage to eat up one single baobab,853.78,867.083,13.302999999999997
the idea of the herd of elephants made the little prince laugh,867.931,871.086,3.1549999999999727
they would have to be piled up on top of each other,871.684,874.123,2.439000000000078
but he remarked wisely the baobab trees before they grow up start off small,875.0360000000001,880.547,5.510999999999967
that is right but why do you want the sheep to eat the little baobabs,881.2660000000001,885.408,4.141999999999939
he replied oh come on as if it were obvious and it took me a great mental effort to understand this problem on my own without any help,886.136,895.66,9.524000000000001
and indeed on the planet of the little prince there were like on all planets both good plants and bad plants and therefore both good seeds from good plants and bad seeds from bad plants,896.244,909.484,13.240000000000009
but seeds are invisible,910.043,911.357,1.3139999999999645
they sleep secretly deep in the earth until on a whim one of them decides to wake up,911.9110000000001,917.683,5.7719999999999345
then it elongates and grows timidly at first toward the sun a charming little harmless sprig,918.182,924.829,6.6469999999999345
if it is a sprig of radish or rose bush you can let it grow as it likes,925.527,929.191,3.6639999999999873
but if it is a bad plant one must pull the plant out straight away as soon as it can be recognised,929.774,935.865,6.091000000000008
now there were some terrible seeds on the planet of the little prince,936.918,940.2370000000001,3.3190000000000737
there were the seeds of baobab trees,940.806,943.135,2.328999999999951
the soil of the planet was infested with them,943.743,946.057,2.3139999999999645
a baobab if you get to it too late can never be got rid of,946.9,951.2919999999999,4.391999999999939
it takes over the entire planet pierces it with its roots,951.876,956.0630000000001,4.1870000000001255
and if the planet is too small and if there are too many baobabs they shatter it to pieces,956.412,962.658,6.245999999999981
it is a matter of discipline,963.531,965.0799999999999,1.5489999999999782
the little prince told me later,965.4200000000001,967.044,1.62399999999991
after grooming oneself in the morning the planet must be carefully groomed,967.488,971.985,4.496999999999957
you must see to it that you regularly pull out the baobabs as soon as they can be told apart from the rose bushes to which they look very similar when they are very young,972.539,981.485,8.946000000000026
it is a very boring job but very easy,982.213,984.931,2.7180000000000746
and one day he suggested that i apply myself to making a beautiful drawing so that the children from where i come would understand all this,986.024,993.961,7.937000000000012
if one day they travel he said to me it could come in useful,994.72,998.712,3.991999999999962
sometimes there is no harm in postponing one 's work but in the case of baobabs that always leads to a catastrophe,999.1659999999999,1006.242,7.076000000000022
i used to know a planet inhabited by a lazy man,1006.935,1010.0,3.0650000000000546
he had neglected three little bushes,1010.588,1013.057,2.469000000000051
and based on what the little prince told me i drew this planet,1013.806,1017.6930000000001,3.8870000000000573
i do not like to sound like a moralist but the danger of the baobabs is so little understood and the risks run by anyone who might get lost on an asteroid are so large that for once i am breaking my normal reserve,1018.322,1031.51,13.187999999999988
i say children beware of baobabs,1032.069,1035.271,3.201999999999998
it is to warn my friends of the danger they have long been skirting like myself without knowing it that i have worked so hard on this drawing,1036.025,1043.466,7.4409999999998035
the lesson which i pass on by this means was worth the effort,1044.24,1047.664,3.423999999999978
you might be wondering why is it that in this book there are not any other drawings as impressive as the drawing of the baobabs,1048.367,1054.999,6.632000000000062
the answer is simple,1055.547,1056.532,0.9849999999999
i tried but i could not succeed,1057.061,1058.68,1.6190000000001419
when i drew the baobabs i was spurred on by a sense of urgency,1059.259,1063.522,4.26299999999992
oh little prince i came to understand gradually in this way your sad life,1064.695,1069.859,5.163999999999987
for a long time your only entertainment was the softness of the sunsets,1071.166,1075.815,4.649000000000115
i learned this new detail on the fourth day in the morning when you said to me i am very fond of sunsets,1076.528,1083.2649999999999,6.736999999999853
let us go and see a sunset now,1083.525,1085.234,1.7089999999998327
but we have to wait,1085.962,1087.1219999999998,1.1599999999998545
wait for what,1087.92,1088.835,0.9149999999999636
wait until the sun goes down,1089.613,1091.218,1.6050000000000182
you seemed surprised at first and then you chuckled at yourself and you said i think myself at home still,1092.4299999999998,1098.987,6.557000000000244
indeed when it is noon in the united states the sun everybody knows is setting over france,1099.755,1105.993,6.237999999999829
it would suffice to be able to go to france in one minute to be able to see a sunset,1106.7559999999999,1111.6950000000002,4.939000000000306
unfortunately france is much too far away but on your tiny planet all you needed was to move your chair a few steps and you watched the twilight falling whenever you liked,1112.383,1123.923,11.539999999999964
one day i saw the sunset forty four times,1124.9650000000001,1127.705,2.7399999999997817
and a little later you added you know you love the sunset when you are really sad,1128.433,1134.26,5.826999999999998
the day you saw it forty four times were you were really that sad then,1135.342,1139.7559999999999,4.41399999999976
but the little prince made no reply,1140.649,1142.368,1.719000000000051
on the fifth day again thanks to the sheep this secret of the little prince 's life was revealed to me,1142.4489999999998,1148.3609999999999,5.912000000000035
he asked abruptly without anything leading up to it as if it was the result of a long silent meditation on a problem,1149.2939999999999,1156.5159999999998,7.22199999999998
if a sheep eats shrubs then does it eat flowers too,1157.569,1161.277,3.7080000000000837
a sheep eats everything it finds,1162.1799999999998,1163.9389999999999,1.7590000000000146
even flowers that have thorns,1164.8619999999999,1166.7469999999998,1.884999999999991
yes even flowers that have thorns,1167.331,1169.45,2.119000000000142
what are the thorns for then,1170.463,1172.173,1.7100000000000364
i did not know the answer,1173.085,1174.2749999999999,1.1899999999998272
i was very busy trying to unscrew a bolt in my engine that had got stuck,1174.475,1178.629,4.153999999999996
i was very worried because my breakdown was beginning to appear to be very serious and i had so little drinking water left that i had to fear the worst,1179.0919999999999,1188.383,9.291000000000167
what are the thorns for then,1189.48,1191.345,1.865000000000009
the little prince never let go of a question once he had asked it,1192.158,1195.2469999999998,3.088999999999942
i was upset over the bolt and i said the first thing that came into my head,1195.6309999999999,1200.075,4.444000000000187
the thorns are of no use at all,1200.7279999999998,1202.493,1.7650000000001
flowers have thorns just for spite,1202.7069999999999,1204.662,1.9550000000001546
oh,1205.6689999999999,1206.114,0.4450000000001637
but after a moment of silence he exclaimed with a sort of resentment,1207.4009999999998,1210.9299999999998,3.5289999999999964
i do not believe you,1211.549,1212.5739999999998,1.0249999999998636
flowers are weak creatures,1212.898,1214.663,1.7650000000001
they are naive,1214.663,1215.532,0.8689999999999145
they reassure themselves as best they can,1215.732,1218.3709999999999,2.6389999999998963
they think themselves frightful with their thorns,1218.9389999999999,1221.528,2.589000000000169
i made no reply,1222.541,1223.61,1.06899999999996
at that moment i was thinking to myself if this bolt will not budge i will knock it out with a hammer,1224.2939999999999,1230.001,5.707000000000107
the little prince interrupted my thoughts again,1231.128,1233.423,2.2950000000000728
and you actually believe that flowers,1234.306,1236.551,2.244999999999891
no no i do not believe it at all,1236.551,1239.04,2.4890000000000327
i answered the first thing that came to my mind,1239.4779999999998,1241.943,2.4650000000001455
i myself am busy with matters of consequence,1242.397,1245.191,2.7940000000000964
he looked at me dumbfounded,1245.979,1247.579,1.599999999999909
matters of consequence,1248.152,1249.787,1.634999999999991
he watched me hammer in hand and my fingers black with grease leaning on an object that would have seemed to him very ugly,1250.49,1257.6119999999999,7.121999999999844
you talk just like the grownups,1258.3,1260.0549999999998,1.7549999999998818
that made me feel a little ashamed but he went on relentlessly,1260.768,1264.6209999999999,3.852999999999838
you confuse everything,1265.344,1266.629,1.2849999999998545
you mix everything up,1266.963,1268.193,1.2300000000000182
he was really very angry,1268.786,1270.341,1.5549999999998363
he shook his golden curls in the breeze,1270.6,1272.995,2.394999999999982
i know a planet where there is a redfaced gentleman,1273.897,1276.661,2.7640000000001237
he has never smelled a flower,1276.856,1278.436,1.5799999999999272
he has never looked at a star,1278.6799999999998,1280.0049999999999,1.3250000000000455
he has never loved anyone,1280.233,1281.744,1.5109999999999673
he has never done anything but sums and all day long he repeats just like you,1282.138,1287.033,4.894999999999982
i am busy with matters of consequence,1287.295,1289.545,2.25
and that makes him swell up with pride,1289.7649999999999,1291.7939999999999,2.0289999999999964
but this is not a man,1292.223,1293.368,1.1449999999999818
he is a mushroom,1293.368,1294.627,1.2590000000000146
a what,1295.211,1295.7659999999998,0.5549999999998363
a mushroom,1296.12,1297.03,0.9100000000000819
the little prince was now white with rage,1297.608,1300.012,2.4039999999999964
flowers have been growing thorns for millions of years,1300.9299999999998,1303.94,3.0100000000002183
for millions of years the sheep have eaten the flowers all the same,1304.264,1307.713,3.449000000000069
and it is not a matter of consequence to try to understand why they take so much trouble to grow thorns which are never of any use,1308.127,1315.071,6.94399999999996
is the war between the flowers and sheep not important,1315.724,1318.683,2.95900000000006
is it not of more consequence and more important than the sums of a fat redfaced gentleman,1318.998,1324.211,5.212999999999965
and if i myself know of a unique flower which grows nowhere but on my planet that a little sheep can destroy in one stroke just like that one morning without realising what he is done,1324.57,1335.425,10.855000000000018
is that not important,1335.425,1337.367,1.9420000000000073
he blushed and continued,1337.9499999999998,1339.379,1.4290000000000873
if someone loves a flower of which just one specimen exists amongst the millions and millions of stars it is enough to make him happy when he looks at them,1340.222,1348.8799999999999,8.657999999999902
he can say my flower is out there somewhere,1349.254,1352.038,2.7840000000001055
but if the sheep eats the flower for him it is as if suddenly all the stars have gone out,1352.617,1357.521,4.903999999999996
and you think that is not important,1357.9099999999999,1359.559,1.6490000000001146
he could not say anything more,1360.4569999999999,1361.7669999999998,1.3099999999999454
he suddenly burst into tears,1362.3509999999999,1364.185,1.83400000000006
night had fallen,1364.923,1365.923,1.0
i had put down my tools of what moment was my hammer my bolt or thirst or death,1366.916,1373.088,6.1720000000000255
there was on a star on a planet my planet earth a little prince to be comforted,1373.906,1379.857,5.951000000000022
i took him in my arms,1380.61,1381.955,1.3450000000000273
i rocked him,1382.1989999999998,1382.899,0.7000000000000455
i said the flower that you love is not in danger,1383.163,1386.606,3.4429999999999836
i will draw you a muzzle for your sheep,1387.19,1389.3049999999998,2.1149999999997817
i will draw you a railing for your flower,1389.3049999999998,1391.475,2.1700000000000728
i,1391.475,1391.675,0.20000000000004547
i,1391.675,1391.783,0.10799999999994725
i was not sure what to say,1392.616,1393.936,1.3199999999999363
i felt very awkward,1394.8039999999999,1396.129,1.3250000000000455
i did not know how to reach him where to find him,1396.657,1399.052,2.394999999999982
it is so secretive the land of tears,1399.8249999999998,1402.109,2.2840000000001055
i learned very quickly to know this flower better,1403.203,1406.1019999999999,2.8989999999998872
there had always been very simple flowers on the planet of the little prince decorated with a single row of petals that did not take up any space and did not bother anyone,1406.781,1417.062,10.280999999999949
they would appear one morning in the grass and by evening they would have faded away,1417.62,1422.3039999999999,4.683999999999969
but this one had sprouted one day from a seed blown in from no one knows where and the little prince had watched very closely this sprout that was not like the other sprouts,1423.1419999999998,1433.4669999999999,10.325000000000045
it could have been a new kind of baobab,1434.016,1435.8899999999999,1.8739999999997963
but the shrub soon stopped growing and began to produce a flower,1436.663,1440.991,4.3279999999999745
the little prince who witnessed the appearance of a huge bud felt that a miraculous apparition must emerge from it,1441.8739999999998,1449.221,7.347000000000207
but the flower never stopped preparing for her future beauty,1449.864,1453.139,3.2749999999998636
safe in her green chamber she chose her colors carefully,1453.139,1457.3159999999998,4.176999999999907
she dressed slowly,1457.615,1458.81,1.1949999999999363
she arranged her petals one by one,1459.029,1461.739,2.7100000000000364
she did not want to come out all rumpled like the poppies,1462.048,1465.591,3.5429999999998927
she would only want to appear in the full radiance of her beauty,1465.995,1470.059,4.064000000000078
oh yes she was a very flirtatious creature,1470.612,1473.9009999999998,3.28899999999976
and her mysterious adornment had thus lasted for days and days,1474.474,1479.3519999999999,4.877999999999929
then one morning exactly at sunrise she suddenly showed herself,1480.0059999999999,1485.134,5.128000000000156
and after having worked with such care and attention to detail she said with a yawn oh i have only just woken up,1485.682,1494.4969999999998,8.814999999999827
i do apologize,1494.801,1495.9759999999999,1.1749999999999545
i am not yet presentable,1495.9759999999999,1497.29,1.3140000000000782
the little prince could not restrain his admiration,1498.248,1500.812,2.563999999999851
you are so beautiful,1501.596,1503.07,1.4739999999999327
am i not,1503.724,1504.683,0.95900000000006
the flower responded sweetly,1504.918,1506.7869999999998,1.8689999999999145
and i was born at the same moment as the sun,1507.5,1509.915,2.4149999999999636
the little prince guessed easily enough that she was not very modest,1510.947,1514.731,3.7840000000001055
but how moving she was,1515.1499999999999,1516.92,1.7700000000002092
it is time i think for breakfast,1518.013,1520.2579999999998,2.244999999999891
she added an instant later,1520.2579999999998,1521.9009999999998,1.643000000000029
if you would have the kindness to think of my needs,1522.67,1525.254,2.5839999999998327
and the little prince completely abashed having gone to look for a sprinkling can of fresh water tended to the flower,1525.9569999999999,1533.353,7.3960000000001855
and like that she had soon begun to torment him with her vanity,1533.862,1537.96,4.097999999999956
one day for example speaking of her four thorns she told the little prince let them come the tigers with their claws,1538.609,1546.615,8.006000000000085
there are not any tigers on my planet,1547.3229999999999,1549.368,2.0450000000000728
the little prince objected,1549.632,1550.9409999999998,1.3089999999997417
and tigers do not eat weeds,1551.1309999999999,1553.1499999999999,2.0190000000000055
i am not a weed,1553.8429999999998,1555.023,1.1800000000000637
the flower replied sweetly,1555.307,1556.931,1.6240000000000236
please forgive me,1557.5149999999999,1558.365,0.8500000000001364
i do not fear tigers but i detest drafts,1559.277,1563.045,3.768000000000029
you would not happen to have a screen,1563.254,1565.078,1.8240000000000691
detests drafts,1565.846,1567.271,1.4249999999999545
that is bad luck for a plant,1567.5349999999999,1569.2489999999998,1.7139999999999418
remarked the little prince,1569.6129999999998,1570.783,1.1700000000000728
what a very complicated flower,1571.396,1573.116,1.7200000000000273
in the evening you will put me under a glass dome,1574.143,1577.148,3.0049999999998818
it is very cold where you live,1577.148,1579.031,1.8830000000000382
where i come from,1579.33,1580.725,1.3949999999999818
but she interrupted herself,1581.453,1582.933,1.4800000000000182
she had come in the form of a seed,1583.282,1585.257,1.9750000000001364
she could not have known anything of other worlds,1585.5369999999998,1587.7549999999999,2.2180000000000746
humiliated at having been caught out on a lie so naive she coughed two or three times to imply the little prince was in the wrong,1588.663,1597.115,8.451999999999998
the screen,1597.734,1598.4389999999999,0.7049999999999272
i was just going to look for it when you spoke to me,1599.302,1601.5259999999998,2.2239999999999327
then she forced a cough to inflict still more remorse,1602.379,1605.638,3.2590000000000146
so the little prince despite the good will of his love had soon come to doubt her,1606.2759999999998,1611.139,4.863000000000056
he had taken seriously words of no importance and had become very unhappy,1611.673,1616.796,5.123000000000047
i should not have listened to her,1617.694,1619.183,1.4890000000000327
he told me one day,1619.4579999999999,1620.498,1.040000000000191
you should never listen to the flowers,1621.051,1623.021,1.9700000000000273
we must look at them and breathe their fragrance,1623.405,1626.228,2.8230000000000928
mine perfumed my whole planet but i did not know how to take pleasure in it,1626.762,1631.335,4.573000000000093
this business of the claws which annoyed me so much should only have filled my heart with tenderness and pity,1632.0729999999999,1638.135,6.0620000000001255
he continued his confidences,1639.0929999999998,1640.798,1.7050000000001546
i did not know how to understand,1641.516,1643.356,1.8399999999999181
i should have her judged by her deeds and not by her words,1643.899,1647.013,3.1140000000000327
she overwhelmed me with her fragrance and light,1647.632,1650.056,2.423999999999978
i should never have run away,1650.655,1651.895,1.240000000000009
i should have seen the tenderness behind her contrivances,1652.658,1655.462,2.8040000000000873
flowers are so contradictory,1656.186,1657.8799999999999,1.69399999999996
but i was too young to know how to love her,1658.4879999999998,1660.518,2.0300000000002
i think that for his escape he took advantage of a migration of a flock of wild birds,1662.033,1667.4499999999998,5.416999999999916
on the morning of his departure he put his planet in perfect order,1667.954,1672.062,4.107999999999947
he carefully swept out his active volcanoes,1672.6309999999999,1675.42,2.7890000000002146
he owned two active volcanoes,1675.684,1677.6689999999999,1.9849999999999
it was very convenient for heating his breakfast in the morning,1677.6689999999999,1680.542,2.8730000000000473
he also owned an extinct volcano but as he used to say you never know so he cleaned out the extinct volcano too,1680.951,1688.7179999999998,7.766999999999825
if they are well cleaned out volcanoes burn slowly and steadily without any eruptions,1689.306,1694.915,5.608999999999924
volcanic eruptions are like fires in a chimney,1695.3339999999998,1698.208,2.874000000000251
on our earth we are obviously much too small to clean out our volcanoes,1698.652,1702.996,4.344000000000051
that is why they cause us no end of trouble,1703.29,1705.399,2.1089999999999236
the little prince also pulled up with a hint of sadness the last little shoots of the baobabs,1706.532,1712.109,5.576999999999998
he believed he would never return,1712.603,1714.158,1.5549999999998363
but all these familiar tasks seemed on that morning very precious,1714.806,1719.0949999999998,4.28899999999976
and as he watered the flower one last time and prepared to shelter her under her dome he found himself close to tears,1719.5439999999999,1727.2649999999999,7.721000000000004
goodbye he said to the flower but she did not answer,1728.088,1731.61,3.5219999999999345
goodbye he said again,1732.3829999999998,1734.087,1.7040000000001783
the flower coughed but it was not because she had a cold,1734.87,1737.9789999999998,3.1089999999999236
i was silly,1739.34,1740.1149999999998,0.7749999999998636
she said finally,1740.3849999999998,1741.315,0.930000000000291
i ask your forgiveness,1741.853,1743.193,1.3399999999999181
try to be happy,1743.552,1744.3919999999998,0.8399999999999181
he was surprised by this absence of reproaches,1745.4589999999998,1748.1979999999999,2.7390000000000327
he stood there all bewildered the dome held in mid air,1748.752,1752.475,3.7229999999999563
he did not understand this quiet sweetness,1752.809,1755.753,2.94399999999996
of course i love you,1756.786,1758.0949999999998,1.3089999999997417
the flower said to him,1758.34,1759.5049999999999,1.1649999999999636
it is my fault that you did not know,1760.248,1761.952,1.7039999999999509
that is of no importance,1762.326,1763.596,1.2699999999999818
but you have been just as foolish as i have,1764.09,1766.024,1.933999999999969
try to be happy,1766.7779999999998,1767.6019999999999,0.8240000000000691
let the dome be,1768.301,1769.2649999999999,0.9639999999999418
i do not want it anymore,1769.4899999999998,1770.6799999999998,1.1900000000000546
but the wind,1771.3229999999999,1772.0929999999998,0.7699999999999818
my cold is not all that bad,1772.761,1774.451,1.6900000000000546
the cool night air will do me good,1774.8799999999999,1776.9589999999998,2.078999999999951
i am a flower,1777.158,1777.973,0.8150000000000546
but the animals,1778.6709999999998,1779.656,0.9850000000001273
i will have to endure two or three caterpillars if i wish to become acquainted with the butterflies,1780.3049999999998,1785.2669999999998,4.961999999999989
it seems that they are very beautiful and otherwise who else will come to visit me,1785.726,1790.812,5.085999999999785
you will be far away,1791.226,1792.436,1.209999999999809
as for the large animals i am not at all afraid of anything,1792.969,1796.7579999999998,3.78899999999976
i have my claws,1797.1619999999998,1798.541,1.3790000000001328
and naively she showed her four thorns,1799.185,1802.194,3.0090000000000146
then she added do not linger like this,1802.773,1805.531,2.758000000000038
it is tiresome,1805.531,1806.376,0.8450000000000273
you have decided to leave,1806.57,1808.027,1.4570000000001073
now go,1808.027,1808.614,0.5869999999999891
for she did not want him to see her crying,1809.388,1811.542,2.1539999999999964
she was such a proud flower,1812.086,1813.6549999999997,1.5689999999997326
he found himself in the neighborhood of the asteroids 325 326 327 328 329 and 330,1813.8649999999998,1823.0309999999997,9.16599999999994
so he began by visiting them to learn more,1823.5149999999996,1826.3539999999998,2.839000000000169
the first one was inhabited by a king,1827.1869999999997,1829.6409999999998,2.4540000000001783
the king was sitting dressed in purple and ermine on a very simple yet majestic throne,1830.3589999999997,1835.9569999999997,5.597999999999956
ah here comes a subject exclaimed the king when he caught sight of the little prince,1836.6849999999997,1841.3569999999997,4.6720000000000255
and the little prince asked himself how could he recognise me when he has never seen me before,1841.9509999999998,1847.0179999999998,5.067000000000007
he did not know that for kings the world is very much simplified,1847.7159999999997,1851.9089999999997,4.192999999999984
to them all men are subjects,1852.1579999999997,1854.0379999999998,1.8800000000001091
approach so that i may see you better said the king who was very proud to finally be king over somebody,1854.8109999999997,1860.9629999999997,6.152000000000044
the little prince looked around him for a place to sit but the planet was completely taken over by the magnificent ermine robe so he remained standing and since he was tired he yawned,1862.0549999999998,1873.6899999999998,11.634999999999991
it is contrary to etiquette to yawn in the presence of a king,1874.2729999999997,1877.3169999999998,3.0440000000000964
the monarch said to him i forbid you to do so,1877.5469999999998,1880.2999999999997,2.752999999999929
i can not stop myself replied the little prince thoroughly embarrassed,1881.1279999999997,1885.1259999999997,3.9980000000000473
i have come on a long journey and i have not slept,1885.6699999999998,1888.3489999999997,2.67899999999986
ah then the king said i order you to yawn,1888.8379999999997,1892.1759999999997,3.3379999999999654
i have not seen anyone yawning for years,1892.5209999999997,1894.5199999999998,1.9990000000000236
yawns to me are objects of curiosity,1894.8699999999997,1897.3789999999997,2.5090000000000146
come now yawn again,1897.6929999999998,1898.8069999999998,1.1140000000000327
it is an order,1898.8069999999998,1899.4219999999998,0.6150000000000091
that frightens me,1900.2799999999997,1901.4139999999998,1.1340000000000146
i can not any more said the little prince blushing,1901.7939999999996,1904.4569999999997,2.663000000000011
hum hum replied the king then i i order you sometimes to yawn and sometimes to,1905.0459999999998,1913.2029999999997,8.156999999999925
he sputtered a bit and seemed vexed,1913.7859999999998,1915.8809999999999,2.0950000000000273
for the king fundamentally insisted that his authority be respected,1916.3389999999997,1920.2729999999997,3.933999999999969
he did not tolerate disobedience,1920.5419999999997,1922.5119999999997,1.9700000000000273
he was an absolute monarch but because he was good at heart he gave reasonable orders,1922.7559999999999,1928.9069999999997,6.15099999999984
if i ordered a general he would often say if i ordered a general to change himself into a seabird and if the general did not obey me it would not be the general 's fault,1929.7749999999996,1940.0789999999997,10.304000000000087
it would be my fault,1940.4329999999998,1941.5429999999997,1.1099999999999
may i sit down the little prince enquired timidly,1942.5599999999997,1945.8479999999997,3.288000000000011
i order you to sit down replied the king who majestically gathered in a fold of his ermine mantle,1946.4219999999998,1952.3789999999997,5.95699999999988
but the little prince was astonished the planet was tiny,1953.3119999999997,1956.8349999999998,3.5230000000001382
over what could this king really rule,1957.2039999999997,1959.8429999999998,2.6390000000001237
sire he said to him excuse my asking you a question,1960.9209999999998,1965.2029999999997,4.281999999999925
i order you to ask me a question hastened to say the king,1965.6269999999997,1968.9099999999999,3.283000000000129
sire over what do you rule,1969.5339999999997,1971.6079999999997,2.074000000000069
over everything said the king with a magnificent simplicity,1972.3109999999997,1975.9699999999998,3.6590000000001055
over everything the king made a subtle gesture pointing out his planet the other planets and the stars,1976.6979999999999,1983.5789999999997,6.880999999999858
over all that asked the little prince,1984.4119999999998,1986.8459999999998,2.433999999999969
over all that the king answered,1987.4849999999997,1989.5939999999998,2.109000000000151
for his rule was not only absolute it was also universal,1990.0419999999997,1993.9659999999997,3.923999999999978
and the stars obey you,1994.6989999999998,1996.0539999999996,1.3549999999997908
of course the king said,1996.6579999999997,1998.2009999999998,1.54300000000012
they obey instantly,1998.5259999999998,2000.0499999999997,1.5239999999998872
i do not tolerate insubordination,2000.4739999999997,2002.2329999999997,1.7590000000000146
such power filled the little prince with wonder,2003.4259999999997,2006.1149999999998,2.689000000000078
if he had held it himself he would have been able to watch not forty four but seventy two or even a hundred or even two hundred sunsets on the same day without ever having to move his chair,2006.4989999999998,2018.1239999999998,11.625
and as he felt a bit sad as he remembered his forsaken little planet he plucked up his courage to ask the king a favour,2019.1419999999998,2026.3079999999998,7.16599999999994
i would like to see a sunset,2027.5199999999998,2029.0599999999997,1.5399999999999636
do that for me,2029.5439999999999,2030.4129999999998,0.8689999999999145
order the sun to set,2030.6929999999998,2031.8569999999997,1.1639999999999873
if i ordered a general to fly from one flower to another like a butterfly or to write a tragic drama or to change himself into a sea bird and if the general did not carry out the order received which one of us would be in the wrong,2032.7899999999997,2045.4879999999998,12.698000000000093
you said the little prince firmly,2046.1369999999997,2048.3259999999996,2.188999999999851
exactly one must ask of each person that which they can give,2048.9689999999996,2053.5409999999997,4.572000000000116
the king went on,2053.7999999999997,2054.6449999999995,0.8449999999997999
authority is based above all on reason,2055.1639999999998,2058.1919999999996,3.0279999999997926
if you ordered your people to go and throw themselves into the sea they would rise up in revolution,2058.781,2063.8039999999996,5.0229999999996835
i have the right to demand obedience because my orders are reasonable,2064.542,2067.787,3.244999999999891
then my sunset the little prince reminded him who never forgot a question once he had asked it,2068.8089999999997,2074.0319999999997,5.222999999999956
you shall have your sunset,2074.865,2075.9649999999997,1.099999999999909
i shall command it but i shall wait according to my science of government until conditions are favourable,2076.249,2082.341,6.092000000000098
when will that be inquired the little prince,2083.169,2085.5829999999996,2.41399999999976
hum hum replied the king who consulted a bulky almanac,2086.162,2090.959,4.7970000000000255
hum hum that will be about about that will be this evening about twenty minutes to eight,2091.618,2101.04,9.422000000000025
and you will see how well i am obeyed,2101.4489999999996,2103.6639999999998,2.2150000000001455
the little prince yawned,2104.5769999999998,2105.812,1.2350000000001273
he was regretting his lost sunset and then he was already getting a little bored,2106.401,2111.4889999999996,5.087999999999738
i have nothing more to do here,2112.3819999999996,2113.7709999999997,1.3890000000001237
he said to the king,2114.0559999999996,2115.2209999999995,1.1649999999999636
i will set off,2115.2209999999995,2116.0389999999998,0.818000000000211
do not go said the king who was very proud of having a subject,2116.558,2120.341,3.7829999999999018
do not go,2120.6699999999996,2121.1949999999997,0.525000000000091
i will make you a minister,2121.459,2122.5339999999997,1.074999999999818
minister of what,2123.138,2124.102,0.9639999999999418
minister of of justice,2124.6609999999996,2127.249,2.588000000000193
but there is nobody here to judge,2127.968,2129.6519999999996,1.6839999999997417
we do not know that,2130.341,2131.3799999999997,1.03899999999976
the king said to him,2131.595,2132.4599999999996,0.8649999999997817
i have not yet made a complete tour of my kingdom,2132.4599999999996,2135.448,2.9880000000002838
i am very old,2136.1259999999997,2137.171,1.0450000000000728
i have no space for a carriage and it tires me to walk,2137.171,2139.79,2.619000000000142
oh but i have already looked said the little prince who leant over to give one more glance at the other side of the planet,2140.678,2146.9049999999997,6.226999999999862
there was no one there either,2147.379,2148.5829999999996,1.2039999999997235
then you shall judge yourself,2149.441,2151.2459999999996,1.8049999999998363
the king answered,2151.2459999999996,2152.035,0.7890000000002146
that is the most difficult thing of all,2152.375,2154.3039999999996,1.9289999999996326
it is much more difficult to judge oneself than to judge someone else,2154.9869999999996,2158.586,3.59900000000016
if you succeed in judging yourself rightly then you are truly wise,2159.1949999999997,2163.0679999999998,3.8730000000000473
yes said the little prince,2163.787,2165.816,2.0289999999999964
but i can judge myself anywhere,2165.816,2167.8549999999996,2.03899999999976
i do not have to live here,2168.2789999999995,2169.5539999999996,1.275000000000091
hum hum said the king,2170.2019999999998,2173.1539999999995,2.951999999999771
i am fairly certain that somewhere on my planet there is an old rat,2173.1539999999995,2176.665,3.511000000000422
i hear him at night,2176.814,2177.7619999999997,0.9479999999998654
you can judge this old rat,2178.3309999999997,2179.6259999999997,1.2950000000000728
from time to time you will condemn him to death thus his life will depend on your justice,2179.8849999999998,2185.0379999999996,5.152999999999793
but you will pardon him on each occasion to conserve him,2185.586,2188.167,2.581000000000131
there is only one of him,2188.5029999999997,2189.5249999999996,1.0219999999999345
i replied the little prince do not like to condemn anyone to death,2190.3529999999996,2194.75,4.397000000000389
and now i think i will go on my way,2195.3839999999996,2197.1929999999998,1.8090000000001965
no said the king,2197.7169999999996,2198.9669999999996,1.25
but the little prince having readied himself to leave had no wish to grieve the old monarch,2199.66,2204.8179999999998,5.157999999999902
if your majesty wishes to be promptly obeyed he should be able to give me a reasonable order,2205.7459999999996,2211.018,5.272000000000389
he should be able for example to order me to leave within a minute,2211.4869999999996,2215.5299999999997,4.04300000000012
it seems to me that conditions are favourable,2216.084,2218.528,2.44399999999996
as the king made no answer the little prince hesitated at first then with a sigh took his leave,2219.8149999999996,2226.4559999999997,6.641000000000076
i make you my ambassador,2227.464,2228.8289999999997,1.3649999999997817
the king hastily called out,2229.1229999999996,2230.783,1.6600000000003092
he had a magnificent air of authority,2231.461,2233.741,2.2800000000002
the grownups are very strange,2234.9179999999997,2236.872,1.9540000000001783
the little prince said to himself as he continued on his journey,2237.1319999999996,2240.2659999999996,3.1340000000000146
the second planet was inhabited by a conceited man,2241.466,2244.49,3.0239999999998872
ah here comes a visit from an admirer exclaimed the conceited man from afar the moment he spotted the little prince,2245.1229999999996,2252.3849999999998,7.262000000000171
because to conceited men all other men are admirers,2252.6839999999997,2256.5269999999996,3.842999999999847
good morning said the little prince,2257.281,2259.055,1.7739999999998872
you have a funny hat,2259.5089999999996,2260.5679999999998,1.0590000000001965
it is for saluting,2261.0469999999996,2262.2019999999998,1.1550000000002
the conceited man replied,2262.2019999999998,2263.531,1.3290000000001783
it is to raise in salute when people acclaim me,2263.7509999999997,2266.47,2.719000000000051
unfortunately nobody ever passes by this way,2266.7239999999997,2269.4979999999996,2.7739999999998872
oh really said the little prince who did not understand,2270.2909999999997,2273.47,3.1790000000000873
clap your hands one against the other,2274.144,2275.948,1.8040000000000873
the conceited man advised,2276.1629999999996,2277.5469999999996,1.3840000000000146
the little prince clapped his hands one against the other,2278.35,2281.1549999999997,2.8049999999998363
the conceited man raised his hat in a modest salute,2281.678,2284.8129999999996,3.1349999999997635
this is more fun than the visit to the king,2285.825,2287.9199999999996,2.0949999999998
the little prince said to himself and he began again to clap his hands one against the other,2288.2639999999997,2293.5519999999997,5.288000000000011
the conceited man again raised his hat in a salute,2293.966,2297.0299999999997,3.063999999999851
after five minutes of this exercise the little prince grew tired of the monotony of the game,2297.783,2303.336,5.552999999999884
and what should i do he asked to make the hat come down,2304.388,2308.401,4.01299999999992
but the conceited man did not hear him,2309.1639999999998,2311.0389999999998,1.875
conceited people never hear anything but praise,2311.5379999999996,2314.057,2.519000000000233
do you really admire me a lot,2314.526,2316.5099999999998,1.9839999999999236
he asked the little prince,2316.714,2317.939,1.224999999999909
what does that mean to admire,2318.8419999999996,2320.901,2.0590000000001965
to admire means to recognise that i am the most handsome the best dressed the richest and the most intelligent man on the planet,2321.5739999999996,2328.747,7.173000000000229
but you are the only man on the planet,2329.865,2332.0289999999995,2.16399999999976
do it for me,2332.598,2333.238,0.6399999999998727
admire me just the same,2333.4919999999997,2334.8669999999997,1.375
i admire you said the little prince shrugging his shoulders a little,2335.785,2339.258,3.4729999999999563
but how can that interest you so much,2340.0119999999997,2342.151,2.1390000000001237
and the little prince went away,2343.0339999999997,2344.604,1.5700000000001637
the grownups are certainly very odd,2345.6169999999997,2347.9809999999998,2.3640000000000327
he said to himself as he continued his journey,2348.225,2350.589,2.3640000000000327
the next planet was inhabited by a heavy drinker,2351.7259999999997,2354.575,2.84900000000016
this was a very short visit but it plunged the little prince into a deep sadness,2355.1539999999995,2360.2609999999995,5.106999999999971
what are you doing there,2361.613,2362.613,1.0
he said to the drinker who he found sitting in silence in front of a number of empty bottles and a number of full bottles,2362.9269999999997,2369.89,6.963000000000193
i am drinking replied the drinker gloomily,2370.6079999999997,2373.332,2.72400000000016
why are you drinking,2374.2599999999998,2375.3089999999997,1.0489999999999782
the little prince asked him,2375.5589999999997,2376.774,1.2150000000001455
to forget replied the drinker,2377.4519999999998,2379.7749999999996,2.3229999999998654
to forget what asked the little prince who already felt sorry for him,2380.6279999999997,2384.7859999999996,4.157999999999902
to forget that i am ashamed confessed the drinker lowering his head,2385.7839999999997,2390.062,4.278000000000247
ashamed of what inquired the little prince who wanted to help him,2390.93,2394.519,3.588999999999942
ashamed of drinking concluded the drinker who then shut himself away in the silence,2395.3469999999998,2401.854,6.507000000000062
and the little prince went away puzzled,2402.4269999999997,2404.6269999999995,2.199999999999818
the grownups are certainly very very odd,2405.7389999999996,2409.0319999999997,3.29300000000012
he said to himself as he continued on his journey,2409.2919999999995,2411.8059999999996,2.5140000000001237
the fourth planet belonged to a businessman,2412.2369999999996,2414.287,2.050000000000182
this man was so busy that he did not even raise his head when the little prince arrived,2414.8399999999997,2419.8839999999996,5.043999999999869
good morning the little prince said to him,2420.6419999999994,2422.836,2.1940000000004147
your cigarette has gone out,2423.5889999999995,2424.8839999999996,1.2950000000000728
three and two make five,2426.0359999999996,2428.182,2.1460000000001855
five and seven make twelve,2428.182,2429.7699999999995,1.587999999999738
twelve and three make fifteen,2430.1639999999998,2431.8189999999995,1.6549999999997453
good morning,2432.3779999999997,2432.7719999999995,0.3939999999997781
fifteen and seven make twenty two,2433.2159999999994,2435.5809999999997,2.3650000000002365
twenty two and six make twenty eight,2435.5809999999997,2437.2699999999995,1.6889999999998508
no time to light it again,2437.7539999999995,2438.7239999999997,0.9700000000002547
twenty six and five make thirty one,2439.0779999999995,2441.423,2.3450000000002547
phew phew then that makes five hundred and one million six hundred twenty two thousand seven hundred and thirty one,2441.423,2449.615,8.192000000000007
five hundred million what,2450.9869999999996,2452.1969999999997,1.2100000000000364
huh are you still there,2453.0209999999997,2454.7279999999996,1.70699999999988
five hundred and one million i have forgotten now,2455.5709999999995,2458.1799999999994,2.6089999999999236
i have so much work,2458.5299999999997,2459.3989999999994,0.8689999999996871
i am a man of consequence,2459.8679999999995,2460.9879999999994,1.1199999999998909
i do not amuse myself with balderdash,2461.2269999999994,2462.9819999999995,1.7550000000001091
two and five make seven,2463.8349999999996,2465.4849999999997,1.650000000000091
five hundred and one million what repeated the little prince who had never in his life let go of a question once he had asked it,2465.7039999999997,2472.3659999999995,6.661999999999807
the businessman raised his head,2473.0789999999997,2474.4439999999995,1.3649999999997817
during the fifty four years that i have lived on this planet i have only been disturbed three times,2475.5059999999994,2480.0449999999996,4.539000000000215
the first time was twenty two years ago by some scatterbrain who fell from god knows where,2480.6989999999996,2485.3729999999996,4.673999999999978
he made the most dreadful noise and i made four mistakes in a sum,2485.8419999999996,2489.4799999999996,3.63799999999992
the second time was eleven years ago by an attack of rheumatism,2490.1889999999994,2492.9879999999994,2.798999999999978
i do not get enough exercise,2493.4169999999995,2494.7069999999994,1.2899999999999636
i do not have time to stroll about,2494.9209999999994,2496.5059999999994,1.5850000000000364
i am a man of consequence,2496.8699999999994,2497.9649999999997,1.0950000000002547
the third time well this is it,2498.6279999999997,2500.4879999999994,1.8599999999996726
i was saying then five hundred and one million,2501.0009999999997,2504.365,3.3640000000000327
millions of what,2504.6589999999997,2505.7239999999997,1.0650000000000546
the businessman realised that there was no hope of being left in peace,2506.6769999999997,2510.4259999999995,3.7489999999997963
millions of those little objects that you see sometimes in the sky,2511.1089999999995,2514.3879999999995,3.2789999999999964
flies,2515.2419999999997,2515.816,0.5740000000000691
no no the little things that shine,2516.3499999999995,2518.7099999999996,2.3600000000001273
bees,2519.3929999999996,2519.903,0.5100000000002183
no no the little golden things that make lazy men daydream,2520.6609999999996,2525.2099999999996,4.548999999999978
as for me i am a man of consequence,2525.9589999999994,2528.1579999999994,2.199000000000069
i have no time to daydream,2528.1579999999994,2529.5519999999997,1.3940000000002328
ah the stars,2530.0259999999994,2532.3609999999994,2.3350000000000364
yes that is it the stars,2532.6249999999995,2533.9449999999997,1.3200000000001637
and what do you do with five hundred million stars,2534.7429999999995,2537.4019999999996,2.6590000000001055
five hundred and one million six hundred twenty two thousand seven hundred thirty one,2538.3549999999996,2542.6899999999996,4.335000000000036
i am a man of consequence,2543.2529999999997,2544.3379999999997,1.0850000000000364
i am precise,2544.5429999999997,2545.2569999999996,0.7139999999999418
and what do you do with these stars,2546.0949999999993,2547.7099999999996,1.6150000000002365
what do i do with them,2548.269,2549.1179999999995,0.8489999999997053
yes,2549.5669999999996,2550.0069999999996,0.44000000000005457
nothing,2550.6259999999997,2551.0559999999996,0.4299999999998363
i own them,2551.3899999999994,2552.0099999999998,0.6200000000003456
you own the stars,2552.8579999999997,2554.3929999999996,1.5349999999998545
yes,2554.9659999999994,2555.3659999999995,0.40000000000009095
but i have already seen a king who,2556.2889999999998,2557.9739999999997,1.6849999999999454
kings do not own,2558.1779999999994,2559.4929999999995,1.3150000000000546
they reign over,2559.4929999999995,2560.6179999999995,1.125
it is very different,2560.8519999999994,2561.7269999999994,0.875
and how does owning the stars help you,2562.575,2565.1489999999994,2.5739999999996144
it helps by making me rich,2565.9069999999997,2567.441,1.5340000000001055
and how does being rich help you,2568.4689999999996,2570.3329999999996,1.8640000000000327
to buy more stars if someone discovers some more,2571.0119999999997,2573.6459999999997,2.6340000000000146
this man the little prince said to himself reasons a bit like my poor drinker,2574.7939999999994,2580.0459999999994,5.251999999999953
but he still had some questions,2580.8239999999996,2582.6379999999995,1.8139999999998508
how can you own the stars,2583.6459999999997,2585.5199999999995,1.8739999999997963
who owns them,2586.1089999999995,2586.8239999999996,0.7150000000001455
the businessman retorted grumpily,2587.133,2588.8319999999994,1.6989999999996144
i do not know,2589.441,2590.1109999999994,0.669999999999618
nobody does,2590.3499999999995,2591.1199999999994,0.7699999999999818
then they belong to me because i thought of it first,2591.6839999999997,2593.9289999999996,2.244999999999891
is that all that is necessary,2594.9559999999997,2596.3559999999998,1.400000000000091
certainly,2596.9739999999997,2597.4889999999996,0.5149999999998727
when you find a diamond that belongs to nobody it is yours,2598.048,2600.8179999999998,2.769999999999982
when you discover an island that belongs to nobody it is yours,2601.3369999999995,2604.0559999999996,2.719000000000051
when you get an idea first you take out a patent it is yours,2604.8339999999994,2608.008,3.174000000000433
and i own the stars because no one before me ever thought of owning them,2608.4119999999994,2612.1459999999997,3.7340000000003783
yes that is true said the little prince,2613.0089999999996,2615.0829999999996,2.074000000000069
and what do you do with them,2615.8309999999997,2616.9059999999995,1.074999999999818
i administer them,2617.7789999999995,2618.5989999999997,0.8200000000001637
i count them and recount them said the businessman,2619.008,2621.6159999999995,2.60799999999972
it is difficult but i am a man of consequence,2622.115,2624.4589999999994,2.343999999999596
the little prince was still not satisfied,2625.6859999999997,2627.8809999999994,2.194999999999709
if i owned a scarf i could put it around my neck and take it away with me,2629.2919999999995,2633.8299999999995,4.538000000000011
if i owned a flower i could pick my flower and take it away with me,2634.5239999999994,2638.173,3.649000000000342
but you can not pick the stars,2638.5619999999994,2640.0709999999995,1.5090000000000146
no but i can put them in the bank,2640.8439999999996,2642.6779999999994,1.8339999999998327
what does that mean,2643.566,2644.3259999999996,0.7599999999997635
that means that i write the number of my stars on a little paper and then i lock this paper in a drawer and that is all that is enough,2645.4389999999994,2653.1689999999994,7.730000000000018
that is funny thought the little prince,2654.1209999999996,2656.0549999999994,1.9339999999997417
it is rather poetic but it is of no great consequence,2656.6339999999996,2659.941,3.3070000000002437
on matters of consequence the little prince had ideas which were very different from those of the grownups,2660.9939999999997,2666.4969999999994,5.502999999999702
i myself he continued own a flower that i water every day,2667.4399999999996,2671.9329999999995,4.492999999999938
i own three volcanoes that i sweep out every week as i also sweep out the one that is extinct,2672.4169999999995,2677.7099999999996,5.29300000000012
you never know,2678.2339999999995,2678.8879999999995,0.6539999999999964
it is of some use to my volcanoes and it is of some use to my flower that i own them,2679.432,2684.1609999999996,4.7289999999998145
but you are of no use to the stars,2684.7599999999998,2686.6299999999997,1.8699999999998909
the businessman opened his mouth but he found nothing to say in response,2687.9019999999996,2691.535,3.6330000000002656
and the little prince went away,2691.9639999999995,2693.4689999999996,1.5050000000001091
the grownups are certainly altogether extraordinary,2694.4769999999994,2697.7649999999994,3.288000000000011
he said to himself as he continued on the journey,2697.9599999999996,2700.2739999999994,2.313999999999851
the fifth planet was very strange,2701.8359999999993,2703.7259999999997,1.8900000000003274
it was the smallest of them all,2704.2449999999994,2705.8089999999997,1.5640000000003056
there was just enough room on it to accommodate a street lamp and a lamplighter,2706.2029999999995,2710.7409999999995,4.538000000000011
the little prince could not work out the purpose of having a street lamp and a lamplighter somewhere out in the skies on a planet without any houses or people,2711.5889999999995,2719.5859999999993,7.996999999999844
he said to himself nevertheless it may well be that this man is absurd,2720.4489999999996,2725.1259999999997,4.677000000000135
but he is less absurd than the king than the conceited man the businessman or the drinker,2725.7,2730.6129999999994,4.912999999999556
at least his work has some meaning,2731.1559999999995,2733.0009999999997,1.8450000000002547
when he lights his lamp it is as if he is bringing to life one more star or one more flower,2733.45,2738.5829999999996,5.132999999999811
when he puts out his lamp he sends the flower or the star to sleep,2739.2369999999996,2743.1499999999996,3.913000000000011
that is a beautiful occupation,2743.4739999999997,2744.9179999999997,1.44399999999996
it serves a real purpose because it is pretty,2745.1779999999994,2747.6559999999995,2.4780000000000655
when he arrived on the planet he respectfully saluted the lamplighter,2749.0179999999996,2752.8469999999998,3.8290000000001783
good morning,2753.5199999999995,2754.0899999999997,0.5700000000001637
why have you just put out your lamp,2754.6139999999996,2756.5929999999994,1.9789999999998145
those are the orders replied the lamplighter,2757.1569999999997,2759.3009999999995,2.143999999999778
good morning,2759.7199999999993,2760.1899999999996,0.47000000000025466
what are the orders,2760.9929999999995,2761.8779999999997,0.8850000000002183
that i put out my lamp,2762.3469999999998,2763.5459999999994,1.1989999999996144
good evening,2763.7459999999996,2764.2359999999994,0.4899999999997817
and he lit it again,2764.6349999999998,2765.4339999999997,0.7989999999999782
but why have you just lit it again,2766.3569999999995,2767.9519999999998,1.5950000000002547
those are the orders replied the lamplighter,2768.5009999999997,2770.5999999999995,2.0989999999997053
i do not understand said the little prince,2771.3729999999996,2773.6019999999994,2.2289999999998145
there is nothing to understand said the lamplighter,2774.1859999999997,2776.4799999999996,2.293999999999869
orders are orders,2776.8789999999995,2777.9339999999997,1.055000000000291
good morning,2777.9339999999997,2778.4489999999996,0.5149999999998727
and he put out his lamp,2778.8229999999994,2779.8869999999997,1.0640000000003056
then he sponged his forehead with a handkerchief decorated with red Suares,2780.4509999999996,2784.6939999999995,4.242999999999938
i have a terrible profession,2785.4869999999996,2786.7519999999995,1.2649999999998727
in the old days it was reasonable,2787.2009999999996,2788.9709999999995,1.7699999999999818
i would put the lamp out in the morning and in the evening i would light it,2789.2299999999996,2792.2549999999997,3.025000000000091
i had the rest of the day to rest and the rest of the night to sleep,2792.6839999999997,2796.1669999999995,3.48299999999972
and since then have the orders changed,2797.0349999999994,2799.0639999999994,2.0289999999999964
the orders have not changed said the lamplighter,2799.7329999999997,2802.3869999999997,2.6539999999999964
that is the tragedy,2802.3869999999997,2803.2559999999994,0.8689999999996871
every year the planet has turned faster and faster and the orders have not changed,2803.6099999999997,2808.2079999999996,4.597999999999956
so what then said the little prince,2808.9819999999995,2810.9799999999996,1.9980000000000473
so now that it spins round once every minute,2811.8179999999998,2814.173,2.355000000000018
i no longer have a moment 's rest,2814.173,2816.0229999999997,1.849999999999909
once every minute i light the lamp and put it out again,2816.6219999999994,2819.4609999999993,2.838999999999942
that is funny,2820.3389999999995,2821.0029999999997,0.6640000000002146
where you live a day only lasts a minute,2821.5669999999996,2823.9619999999995,2.394999999999982
it is not funny at all said the lamplighter,2824.3609999999994,2827.0699999999997,2.7090000000002874
we have already been speaking for a month,2827.0699999999997,2828.8079999999995,1.737999999999829
a month,2829.4269999999997,2829.9869999999996,0.5599999999999454
yes,2830.5899999999997,2830.9749999999995,0.38499999999976353
thirty minutes thirty days,2831.1799999999994,2832.7839999999997,1.6040000000002692
good evening,2833.0579999999995,2833.5529999999994,0.49499999999989086
and he lit his lamp again,2834.1269999999995,2835.3109999999997,1.1840000000001965
the little prince watched him and felt that he loved this lamplighter who was so faithful to his orders,2836.4789999999994,2841.5769999999998,5.098000000000411
he remembered the sunsets which he himself had gone to seek in the past by moving his chair,2842.0459999999994,2847.1839999999997,5.138000000000375
he wanted to help his friend,2847.8379999999997,2849.1669999999995,1.3289999999997235
you know i know a way you can rest whenever you want,2850.4199999999996,2853.8629999999994,3.4429999999997563
i always want to said the lamplighter,2854.4759999999997,2856.8099999999995,2.3339999999998327
for it is possible to be both faithful and lazy at the same time,2857.3389999999995,2860.8879999999995,3.548999999999978
the little prince went on,2861.8809999999994,2863.0799999999995,1.1990000000000691
your planet is so small that you can go right round it in three strides,2863.9529999999995,2868.4519999999998,4.499000000000251
you only have to walk along rather slowly to always stay in the sun when you want to rest,2868.8109999999997,2874.5339999999997,5.722999999999956
you can walk and the day will last as long as you like,2874.5339999999997,2877.5719999999997,3.038000000000011
that does not do me much good said the lamplighter,2878.4649999999997,2880.8629999999994,2.3979999999996835
what i really love in life is to sleep,2881.2519999999995,2883.4069999999997,2.1550000000002
that is bad luck said the little prince,2884.1499999999996,2886.1489999999994,1.9989999999997963
that is bad luck said the lamplighter,2886.8119999999994,2888.7659999999996,1.9540000000001783
good morning,2889.0499999999997,2889.5799999999995,0.5299999999997453
and he put out his lamp,2890.0789999999997,2891.2039999999997,1.125
that man said the little prince to himself as he continued further on his journey that man would be despised by all the others by the king by the conceited man by the drinker and by the businessman,2892.2809999999995,2903.9049999999997,11.624000000000251
yet he is the only one that does not seem ridiculous to me,2904.3039999999996,2907.5379999999996,3.2339999999999236
perhaps it is because he thinks of something other than himself,2908.151,2911.066,2.9149999999999636
he breathed a sigh of regret and said to himself,2912.0629999999996,2914.633,2.5700000000001637
that man is the only one with whom i could have made friends but his planet is really very small,2915.3409999999994,2921.1489999999994,5.807999999999993
there is no room on it for two people,2921.6429999999996,2923.3819999999996,1.7390000000000327
what the little prince did not dare admit to himself was that he missed this blessed planet most of all because of the one thousand four hundred and forty sunsets every day,2924.5239999999994,2933.9299999999994,9.405999999999949
the sixth planet was ten times larger than the last,2934.294999999999,2937.4299999999994,3.1350000000002183
it was inhabited by an old gentleman who wrote enormous books,2937.7789999999995,2941.852999999999,4.073999999999614
oh look here comes an explorer,2942.9549999999995,2945.3389999999995,2.3840000000000146
he cried out when he caught sight of the little prince,2945.5929999999994,2948.091999999999,2.4989999999997963
the little prince sat down on the table and panted a little,2949.129999999999,2952.1239999999993,2.994000000000142
he had already travelled so far,2952.5979999999995,2954.4629999999993,1.8649999999997817
where do you come from,2955.140999999999,2956.0259999999994,0.8850000000002183
the old gentleman said to him,2956.3299999999995,2957.7849999999994,1.4549999999999272
what is that big book said the little prince,2958.562999999999,2960.850999999999,2.288000000000011
what do you do here,2961.0509999999995,2962.2199999999993,1.168999999999869
i am a geographer said the old gentleman,2962.7889999999993,2965.0229999999992,2.2339999999999236
what is a geographer,2965.7959999999994,2966.8259999999996,1.0300000000002
he is a scholar who knows the location of the seas the rivers the towns the mountains and the deserts,2967.6089999999995,2973.1069999999995,5.498000000000047
that is very interesting said the little prince,2973.7759999999994,2976.0639999999994,2.288000000000011
that really is at last a real profession,2976.832999999999,2979.0819999999994,2.249000000000251
and he glanced around at the planet of the geographer,2979.8649999999993,2982.3399999999992,2.474999999999909
he had never seen such a majestic planet before,2982.7589999999996,2985.801999999999,3.0429999999996653
your planet is very beautiful he said,2986.8849999999993,2989.3729999999996,2.4880000000002838
are there oceans,2989.6629999999996,2991.0019999999995,1.3389999999999418
i would not know said the geographer,2991.4859999999994,2993.3849999999993,1.8989999999998872
oh,2993.9589999999994,2994.2689999999993,0.30999999999994543
the little prince was disappointed,2994.8819999999996,2996.3719999999994,1.4899999999997817
and mountains,2997.149999999999,2998.0399999999995,0.8900000000003274
i would not know said the geographer,2998.5979999999995,3000.466999999999,1.8689999999996871
and towns and rivers and deserts,3001.3349999999996,3003.4499999999994,2.1149999999997817
i would not know that either said the geographer,3004.1179999999995,3006.2519999999995,2.1340000000000146
but you are a geographer,3007.2849999999994,3008.4799999999996,1.1950000000001637
that is true the geographer said,3009.3179999999993,3011.2319999999995,1.9140000000002146
but i am not an explorer,3011.7509999999993,3013.024999999999,1.2739999999998872
i do not have a single explorer,3013.5189999999993,3015.5379999999996,2.019000000000233
it is not for the geographer to count the towns the rivers the mountains the seas the oceans and the deserts,3015.8519999999994,3021.6609999999996,5.8090000000001965
the geographer is too important to go strolling about,3022.0949999999993,3025.0239999999994,2.9290000000000873
he does not leave his desk but he receives the explorers,3025.3079999999995,3028.7129999999993,3.4049999999997453
he asks them questions and he writes down their recollections,3028.7129999999993,3032.2449999999994,3.532000000000153
and if any of their recollections seem interesting to him the geographer orders an inquiry into that explorer 's moral character,3032.7039999999993,3039.4409999999993,6.73700000000008
why is that,3040.2189999999996,3040.8989999999994,0.6799999999998363
because an explorer who told lies would cause havoc to geography books so would an explorer who drank too much,3041.4079999999994,3048.5029999999992,7.0949999999998
why is that asked the little prince,3049.1469999999995,3051.1799999999994,2.0329999999999018
because intoxicated men see double so the geographer would record two mountains in a place where there was only one,3051.9339999999993,3058.3559999999993,6.4220000000000255
i know someone said the little prince who would make a bad explorer,3059.2789999999995,3062.946999999999,3.6679999999996653
that is possible so when the moral character of the explorer appears to be in order an inquiry is done into his discovery,3063.5649999999996,3071.5989999999993,8.03399999999965
you go to see it,3072.3519999999994,3073.1669999999995,0.8150000000000546
no that would be too complicated,3073.455999999999,3075.6449999999995,2.1890000000003056
but one requires the explorer to provide proof,3075.9839999999995,3078.5079999999994,2.5239999999998872
if for example the discovery in question was of a large mountain one would require that he bring back large stones from it,3078.832999999999,3086.5979999999995,7.765000000000327
the geographer suddenly became excited,3087.2969999999996,3089.2509999999993,1.9539999999997235
but you you come from far away,3089.4599999999996,3091.9749999999995,2.5149999999998727
you are an explorer,3091.9749999999995,3093.6339999999996,1.6590000000001055
you must describe your planet to me,3093.9429999999993,3095.6829999999995,1.7400000000002365
and the geographer having opened his big register sharpened his pencil,3096.455999999999,3100.6899999999996,4.234000000000378
the recitals of explorers are first recorded in pencil,3101.2329999999993,3104.1529999999993,2.9200000000000728
one waits until the explorer has provided proof before recording them in ink,3104.660999999999,3108.8049999999994,4.144000000000233
well said the geographer,3109.5379999999996,3111.0269999999996,1.4890000000000327
oh where i live said the little prince,3111.8099999999995,3114.4939999999992,2.6839999999997417
it is not very interesting,3114.6839999999993,3116.1229999999996,1.4390000000003056
everything is very small,3116.486999999999,3117.9019999999996,1.4150000000004184
i have three volcanoes two active volcanoes and one extinct one,3118.2809999999995,3122.5849999999996,4.304000000000087
but you never know,3122.5849999999996,3123.8229999999994,1.237999999999829
one never knows said the geographer,3124.2769999999996,3126.2559999999994,1.9789999999998145
i also have a flower,3126.9389999999994,3128.1189999999992,1.1799999999998363
we do not record flowers said the geographer,3128.5879999999993,3130.9919999999993,2.4039999999999964
why is that,3131.7799999999993,3132.5199999999995,0.7400000000002365
it is the prettiest thing,3132.7239999999993,3133.928999999999,1.2049999999999272
because flowers are ephemeral,3134.7419999999993,3136.3719999999994,1.6300000000001091
what does that mean ephemeral,3137.1349999999993,3138.8989999999994,1.7640000000001237
geography books said the geographer of all books are the most concerned with matters of consequence,3139.9319999999993,3146.1319999999996,6.200000000000273
they never become out dated,3146.5119999999993,3148.1459999999993,1.6340000000000146
it is very rare that a mountain changes position,3148.8839999999996,3151.9499999999994,3.0659999999998035
it is very rare that an ocean empties itself of its water,3152.3549999999996,3155.8859999999995,3.530999999999949
we write about eternal things,3156.3699999999994,3158.3899999999994,2.019999999999982
but extinct volcanoes can wake up interrupted the little prince,3159.2779999999993,3163.2199999999993,3.9420000000000073
what does ephemeral mean,3163.629999999999,3165.4389999999994,1.8090000000001965
whether volcanoes are extinct or active is of no consequence to us said the geographer,3166.3659999999995,3171.4139999999993,5.0479999999997744
the thing that matters to us is the mountain,3171.937999999999,3174.5269999999996,2.5890000000003965
it does not change,3174.850999999999,3176.1799999999994,1.3290000000001783
but what does ephemeral mean repeated the little prince who had never in his life let go of a question once he had asked it,3176.9679999999994,3183.8849999999993,6.916999999999916
it means which is at risk of imminent disappearance,3184.792999999999,3188.4909999999995,3.69800000000032
is my flower at risk of imminent disappearance,3189.5979999999995,3192.2429999999995,2.644999999999982
of course,3192.6369999999993,3193.2209999999995,0.5840000000002874
my flower is ephemeral,3194.1089999999995,3195.4089999999997,1.300000000000182
the little prince said to himself,3195.7039999999993,3197.2479999999996,1.5440000000003238
and she has only four thorns to defend herself against the world,3197.9609999999993,3201.6159999999995,3.6550000000002
and i have left her all alone on my planet,3201.8009999999995,3204.4499999999994,2.6489999999998872
that was his first moment of regret but he took heart once again,3205.4079999999994,3209.4349999999995,4.027000000000044
what place would you advise me to visit he asked,3210.5829999999996,3213.1469999999995,2.563999999999851
the planet earth replied the geographer,3213.629999999999,3215.6989999999996,2.0690000000004147
it has a good reputation,3216.1429999999996,3217.4829999999993,1.3399999999996908
and the little prince went away thinking of his flower,3218.410999999999,3221.1649999999995,2.75400000000036
so the seventh planet was the earth,3222.5959999999995,3224.5749999999994,1.9789999999998145
the earth is not just any old planet,3225.4229999999993,3227.7529999999992,2.3299999999999272
it has one hundred and eleven kings not forgetting of course the negro kings amongst them,3228.4709999999995,3233.5039999999995,5.032999999999902
seven thousand geographers,3233.9629999999993,3235.6569999999992,1.69399999999996
nine hundred thousand businessmen,3235.8569999999995,3237.6319999999996,1.775000000000091
seven million five hundred thousand heavy drinkers,3237.6319999999996,3240.9219999999996,3.2899999999999636
three hundred and eleven million conceited men,3240.9219999999996,3243.8239999999996,2.9020000000000437
that is to say about two billion grownups,3244.0879999999993,3247.0559999999996,2.968000000000302
to give you an idea of the size of the earth i will tell you that before the invention of electricity it was necessary to maintain over the span of the six continents a veritable army of four hundred and sixty two thousand five hundred and eleven streetlamp lighters,3247.8939999999993,3263.5869999999995,15.693000000000211
seen from a distance it made a wonderful spectacle,3264.2159999999994,3267.5089999999996,3.29300000000012
the movements of this army were regulated like those of an opera ballet,3268.3269999999993,3272.080999999999,3.7539999999999054
first came the turn of the lamplighters of new zealand and australia,3272.8299999999995,3276.3689999999992,3.53899999999976
having set their lamps alight they would go off to bed,3276.8379999999993,3280.0019999999995,3.1640000000002146
next came the turn of the lamplighters of china and siberia to enter into the dance,3280.330999999999,3285.2489999999993,4.91800000000012
then they too would disappear into the wings,3285.7079999999996,3288.2219999999993,2.513999999999669
then came the turn of the lamplighters of russia and the indies,3288.6059999999993,3292.3099999999995,3.7040000000001783
then those of africa and europe,3292.7539999999995,3294.9129999999996,2.1590000000001055
then those of south america,3295.2569999999996,3296.696999999999,1.4399999999995998
then those of north america,3297.0309999999995,3298.3909999999996,1.3600000000001273
and never would they make a mistake in their order of entry on stage,3298.709999999999,3302.9489999999996,4.2390000000004875
it was magnificent,3303.3879999999995,3305.1319999999996,1.7440000000001419
only the lamplighter of the single lamp of the north pole and his colleague at the single lamp of the south pole led lives of leisure,3306.1599999999994,3313.841999999999,7.681999999999789
they worked twice a year,3314.2009999999996,3315.6549999999993,1.4539999999997235
when one wants to be witty it can happen that one bends the truth a little,3316.8189999999995,3321.0879999999993,4.268999999999778
i have not been entirely honest in telling you about the lamplighters,3321.745999999999,3325.7199999999993,3.97400000000016
i run the risk of giving a fasle idea of our planet to those who do not know it,3326.2239999999993,3330.6579999999994,4.4340000000001965
men take up very little space on the earth,3331.3159999999993,3334.0949999999993,2.7789999999999964
if the two billion people who inhabit the earth were to stand upright and Suash together a little like for a meeting they would easily fit on one public Suare twenty miles long and twenty miles wide,3334.9729999999995,3346.9879999999994,12.014999999999873
all humanity could be piled up on the smallest pacific islet,3347.466999999999,3351.8999999999996,4.4330000000004475
the grownups of course will not believe you,3352.5079999999994,3354.5069999999996,1.999000000000251
they picture themselves as taking up a lot of space,3354.9659999999994,3357.7009999999996,2.7350000000001273
they think themselves as important as the baobabs,3357.8999999999996,3360.8689999999992,2.968999999999596
therefore you should advise them to do the math,3361.5319999999992,3363.676999999999,2.144999999999982
they adore numbers and that will please them,3364.0759999999996,3366.0709999999995,1.9949999999998909
but do not waste your time on this chore,3366.3649999999993,3368.359999999999,1.9949999999998909
there is no point,3368.359999999999,3369.2799999999993,0.9200000000000728
you trust me,3369.2799999999993,3370.0179999999996,0.7380000000002838
the little prince having arrived on earth was very surprised not to see anyone,3371.5349999999994,3375.5739999999996,4.039000000000215
he had already started to worry that he had got the wrong planet when a moon colored coil stirred in the sand,3376.0279999999993,3382.5899999999992,6.561999999999898
good evening said the little prince courteously,3383.4579999999996,3386.0319999999992,2.5739999999996144
good evening said the snake,3386.7299999999996,3388.484999999999,1.7549999999996544
on what planet have i come down on asked the little prince,3389.5569999999993,3392.7209999999995,3.1640000000002146
onto earth in africa the snake answered,3393.4039999999995,3396.4519999999993,3.0479999999997744
oh so there is no one on earth,3396.6909999999993,3399.3399999999992,2.6489999999998872
this is the desert,3400.0579999999995,3401.3119999999994,1.2539999999999054
there is no one in the deserts,3401.611999999999,3403.2609999999995,1.649000000000342
the earth is large said the snake,3403.4909999999995,3405.6349999999993,2.143999999999778
the little prince sat down on a stone and raised his eyes toward the sky,3406.5029999999992,3410.7469999999994,4.244000000000142
i wonder he said if the stars are lit so that each of us can one day find his own again,3411.7439999999992,3417.6869999999994,5.943000000000211
look at my planet,3418.1359999999995,3419.359999999999,1.2239999999997053
it is right there above us,3419.783999999999,3421.2029999999995,1.4190000000003238
but it is so far away,3421.5079999999994,3422.9119999999994,1.4039999999999964
it is beautiful said the snake,3423.7799999999993,3425.718999999999,1.9389999999998508
what has brought you here,3426.0879999999993,3427.5569999999993,1.469000000000051
i have been having some trouble with a flower said the little prince,3428.5349999999994,3431.7439999999992,3.2089999999998327
ah said the snake,3432.401999999999,3434.0959999999995,1.6940000000004147
and they were silent,3434.6449999999995,3435.609999999999,0.9649999999996908
where are the men asked the little prince at last,3437.1059999999993,3439.7749999999996,2.669000000000324
it is a bit lonely in the desert,3440.0239999999994,3442.0179999999996,1.9940000000001419
it is also lonely amongst men the snake said,3442.975999999999,3446.0749999999994,3.09900000000016
the little prince gazed at him for a long time,3447.2119999999995,3449.6869999999994,2.474999999999909
you are a funny animal he said finally as thin as a finger,3450.5399999999995,3454.8579999999993,4.317999999999756
but i am more powerful than the finger of a king said the snake,3455.3159999999993,3459.3899999999994,4.074000000000069
the little prince smiled,3460.0779999999995,3461.4579999999996,1.3800000000001091
you are not very powerful,3462.111999999999,3463.696999999999,1.5850000000000364
you have not even got any legs,3463.696999999999,3466.1269999999995,2.430000000000291
you can not even travel,3466.1269999999995,3467.343999999999,1.2169999999996435
i can carry you further than a ship said the snake,3468.316999999999,3471.4999999999995,3.1830000000004475
he wrapped himself around the little prince 's ankle like a golden bracelet,3472.1689999999994,3476.6069999999995,4.438000000000102
whoever i touch i send him back to the earth from which he came,3477.5149999999994,3481.7479999999996,4.233000000000175
he continued,3482.111999999999,3482.7869999999994,0.6750000000001819
but you are pure and you come from a star,3483.2559999999994,3486.5039999999995,3.2480000000000473
the little prince made no reply,3487.3719999999994,3489.080999999999,1.7089999999998327
i feel sorry for you so weak on this earth made of granite,3490.2089999999994,3494.2569999999996,4.048000000000229
i can help you if someday you become too homesick for your planet,3495.1749999999993,3499.6269999999995,4.4520000000002256
i can,3499.8119999999994,3500.7909999999993,0.9789999999998145
i understand very well said the little prince,3501.7799999999993,3504.3989999999994,2.619000000000142
but why do you always speak in riddles,3504.8229999999994,3507.2209999999995,2.3980000000001382
i solve them all said the snake,3508.178999999999,3510.5429999999997,2.3640000000004875
and they were silent,3511.2109999999993,3512.1859999999992,0.974999999999909
the little prince crossed the desert and met only with one flower a flower with three petals a nondescript flower belonging to no one,3513.2499999999995,3521.8209999999995,8.570999999999913
good morning said the little prince,3522.6039999999994,3524.4329999999995,1.8290000000001783
good morning said the flower,3524.9619999999995,3526.5609999999992,1.5989999999997053
where are the men asked the little prince politely,3527.3049999999994,3530.062999999999,2.757999999999811
the flower had once seen a caravan passing,3530.8759999999993,3533.225999999999,2.349999999999909
men i think there exists six or seven of them,3533.7599999999993,3537.1279999999992,3.367999999999938
i saw them years ago,3537.426999999999,3538.5819999999994,1.1550000000002
but you never know where to find them,3538.7759999999994,3540.4159999999993,1.6399999999998727
they are blown here and there by the wind,3540.754999999999,3542.7019999999993,1.9470000000001164
they lack roots,3543.0399999999995,3544.4099999999994,1.3699999999998909
it makes things very difficult for them,3544.4099999999994,3546.312999999999,1.9029999999997926
goodbye said the little prince,3547.294999999999,3548.9389999999994,1.6440000000002328
goodbye said the flower,3549.4029999999993,3550.9069999999992,1.5039999999999054
the little prince climbed a high mountain,3552.0859999999993,3554.2359999999994,2.150000000000091
the only mountains he had ever known were the three volcanoes that came up to his knees and he used the extinct volcano as a footstool,3554.9189999999994,3562.6959999999995,7.777000000000044
from a mountain as high as this one he said to himself i will be able to see the entire planet all at once and all the people,3563.7779999999993,3571.0749999999994,7.2970000000000255
but he saw nothing but sharp needles of rock,3571.9579999999996,3574.705999999999,2.7479999999995925
good morning he said courteously,3575.6689999999994,3577.7179999999994,2.048999999999978
good morning good morning good morning answered the echo,3578.216999999999,3581.4449999999993,3.2280000000000655
who are you said the little prince,3582.2329999999993,3584.2719999999995,2.0390000000002146
who are you who are you who are you answered the echo,3584.7959999999994,3588.1129999999994,3.3170000000000073
be my friends,3588.8369999999995,3589.901999999999,1.0649999999995998
i am all alone he said,3589.901999999999,3591.5459999999994,1.6440000000002328
i am all alone all alone all alone answered the echo,3592.0349999999994,3595.8579999999993,3.8229999999998654
what a funny planet he thought,3596.879999999999,3598.8829999999994,2.0030000000001564
it is all dry and all jagged and all barren and the people have no imagination,3599.341999999999,3604.9339999999993,5.592000000000098
they repeat whatever you say to them,3605.2429999999995,3607.2969999999996,2.0540000000000873
on my planet i had a flower,3608.129999999999,3609.754999999999,1.625
she was always the first to speak,3610.033999999999,3611.9329999999995,1.899000000000342
but it happened that the little prince having walked for a long time through the sands rocks and snow at last came across a road and all roads lead to the dwellings of men,3611.9779999999996,3623.4169999999995,11.43899999999985
good morning he said,3624.4599999999996,3625.8039999999996,1.344000000000051
it was a garden covered in roses,3626.3229999999994,3628.1469999999995,1.8240000000000691
good morning said the roses,3628.7259999999997,3630.6699999999996,1.94399999999996
good morning,3631.5079999999994,3632.1729999999993,0.6649999999999636
good morning,3633.0059999999994,3633.6609999999996,0.6550000000002001
good morning,3634.3439999999996,3634.9589999999994,0.6149999999997817
the little prince gazed at them,3636.5609999999997,3638.0899999999997,1.5289999999999964
they all looked just like his flower,3638.6489999999994,3640.6629999999996,2.0140000000001237
who are you he asked them stunned,3641.4609999999993,3643.6099999999997,2.149000000000342
we are roses the roses said,3644.2039999999997,3646.5529999999994,2.3489999999997053
we are roses,3647.0559999999996,3648.0309999999995,0.974999999999909
we are roses,3648.4699999999993,3649.3849999999993,0.9149999999999636
we are roses,3649.8689999999997,3650.8489999999997,0.9800000000000182
oh said the little prince,3652.0709999999995,3653.7849999999994,1.7139999999999418
and he suddenly felt very unhappy,3654.4439999999995,3656.6079999999997,2.1640000000002146
his flower had told him that she was the only one of her kind in the universe and here were five thousand of them all alike in one single garden,3657.4059999999995,3666.7939999999994,9.38799999999992
she would be very upset he said to himself if she saw this,3667.6819999999993,3671.4489999999996,3.76700000000028
she would cough and cough and pretend to die to avoid being laughed at and i would have to pretend to nurse her back to life to humble myself also because if i did not she really would allow herself to die,3672.0479999999993,3684.3659999999995,12.318000000000211
then he said to himself i thought i was rich with a flower that was one of a kind and all i have is a common rose,3685.2939999999994,3693.0099999999993,7.7159999999998945
that and my three volcanoes that come up to my knees,3693.6029999999996,3696.7579999999994,3.1549999999997453
one which is perhaps forever extinct,3696.7579999999994,3699.0659999999993,2.3079999999999927
that does not make me a very great prince and lying in the grass he started to cry,3699.7489999999993,3705.4349999999995,5.686000000000149
it was then that the fox appeared,3706.6629999999996,3708.5769999999993,1.91399999999976
good morning said the fox,3709.2209999999995,3710.7849999999994,1.5639999999998508
good morning responded the little prince politely who then turned around but saw nothing,3711.6029999999996,3716.9749999999995,5.371999999999844
i am right here the voice said under the apple tree,3717.5479999999993,3720.5009999999997,2.9530000000004293
who are you asked the little prince,3721.4739999999997,3723.4629999999997,1.9890000000000327
you are very pretty,3723.8919999999994,3724.8219999999997,0.930000000000291
i am a fox the fox said,3725.6049999999996,3727.3679999999995,1.76299999999992
come and play with me proposed the little prince,3728.1459999999997,3730.6059999999998,2.4600000000000364
i am so unhappy,3730.6059999999998,3732.1089999999995,1.5029999999997017
i can not play with you said the fox,3732.7629999999995,3734.5169999999994,1.7539999999999054
i am not tamed,3734.8309999999997,3735.6509999999994,0.819999999999709
oh i am sorry said the little prince,3736.4039999999995,3738.7369999999996,2.3330000000000837
but after some thought he added what does that mean tame,3739.3209999999995,3743.0389999999998,3.718000000000302
you are not from here said the fox,3743.7319999999995,3745.4609999999993,1.7289999999998145
what is it that you are looking for,3746.0539999999996,3747.3989999999994,1.3449999999998
i am looking for men said the little prince,3748.2269999999994,3750.5209999999997,2.294000000000324
what does tame mean,3750.7199999999993,3752.5789999999997,1.8590000000003783
men said the fox they have guns and they hunt,3753.3919999999994,3756.8049999999994,3.413000000000011
it is very bothersome,3757.3229999999994,3758.2329999999997,0.9100000000003092
they also raise chickens,3758.8369999999995,3760.5809999999997,1.7440000000001419
it is their sole interest,3760.8749999999995,3761.9699999999993,1.0949999999998
are you looking for chickens,3762.4239999999995,3763.8029999999994,1.3789999999999054
no said the little prince,3764.3169999999996,3765.9409999999993,1.6239999999997963
i am looking for friends,3766.1499999999996,3767.6699999999996,1.5199999999999818
what does tame mean,3767.8989999999994,3769.3439999999996,1.4450000000001637
it is something that is too often forgotten said the fox,3770.1069999999995,3773.2299999999996,3.1230000000000473
it means to establish bonds,3773.4239999999995,3775.8179999999993,2.393999999999778
to establish bonds,3776.5109999999995,3777.8009999999995,1.2899999999999636
that is right said the fox,3778.2649999999994,3779.8089999999993,1.543999999999869
to me you are still only a little boy just like a hundred thousand other little boys,3780.1129999999994,3784.9929999999995,4.880000000000109
and i do not need you and you do not need me either,3784.9929999999995,3787.8899999999994,2.8969999999999345
to you i am only a fox just like a hundred thousand other foxes,3788.5129999999995,3792.2769999999996,3.7640000000001237
but if you tame me we will need each other,3792.9549999999995,3795.4239999999995,2.469000000000051
to me you will be unique in the entire world,3795.9619999999995,3798.9059999999995,2.94399999999996
to you i will be unique in the entire world,3799.3099999999995,3801.9189999999994,2.6089999999999236
i am beginning to understand said the little prince,3802.8269999999993,3805.4659999999994,2.6390000000001237
there is a flower,3806.0889999999995,3807.3339999999994,1.2449999999998909
i think she has tamed me,3807.3339999999994,3808.6279999999997,1.2940000000003238
it is possible said the fox,3809.3759999999997,3811.0549999999994,1.6789999999996326
on earth you see all kinds of things,3811.3539999999994,3813.8329999999996,2.479000000000269
oh but she is not on earth said the little prince,3814.4719999999998,3817.3599999999997,2.88799999999992
the fox seemed very intrigued,3818.0589999999997,3819.7029999999995,1.643999999999778
on another planet,3820.1769999999997,3821.2219999999998,1.0450000000000728
yes,3821.7849999999994,3822.2149999999997,0.43000000000029104
are there hunters on that planet,3823.1379999999995,3825.0779999999995,1.9400000000000546
no,3825.7609999999995,3826.1709999999994,0.4099999999998545
that is interesting,3826.9039999999995,3828.0139999999997,1.1100000000001273
and chickens,3828.7919999999995,3830.1509999999994,1.3589999999999236
no,3830.8249999999994,3831.2249999999995,0.40000000000009095
nothing is perfect sighed the fox,3832.5559999999996,3834.7949999999996,2.2390000000000327
but the fox came back to his idea,3835.5979999999995,3837.423,1.8250000000002728
my life is very monotonous,3838.6399999999994,3840.3349999999996,1.6950000000001637
I hunt chickens,3840.7539999999995,3841.7179999999994,0.9639999999999418
men hunt me,3841.9429999999993,3842.673,0.7300000000004729
all the chickens look alike and all the men look alike,3843.3609999999994,3846.3039999999996,2.943000000000211
so i get a bit bored,3846.7169999999996,3847.8479999999995,1.1309999999998581
but if you tame me it would bring some sunlight into my life,3848.4069999999997,3852.3749999999995,3.967999999999847
i would come to know a sound of footsteps,3852.7989999999995,3854.9639999999995,2.1649999999999636
unlike any other other footsteps send me hurrying back underground yours would call me out of my burrow like music,3854.9639999999995,3862.9929999999995,8.028999999999996
and then look you see the wheat fields down there,3863.2969999999996,3866.2849999999994,2.987999999999829
i do not eat bread,3866.8289999999997,3867.7389999999996,0.9099999999998545
wheat is of no use to me,3868.1329999999994,3869.3919999999994,1.2590000000000146
the wheat fields mean nothing to me and that is sad,3869.9459999999995,3872.7449999999994,2.798999999999978
but your hair is the color of gold so it will be wonderful when you have tamed me,3873.4729999999995,3878.2409999999995,4.768000000000029
the wheat which is golden will remind me of you and i will love the sound of the wind blowing through the wheat,3878.6699999999996,3885.3259999999996,6.655999999999949
the fox went silent and gazed at the little prince for a long time,3886.6079999999997,3890.432,3.824000000000069
please tame me he said,3891.1649999999995,3893.673,2.5080000000002656
i really want to the little prince replied,3894.6109999999994,3897.0249999999996,2.4140000000002146
but i do not have much time,3897.0249999999996,3899.048,2.0230000000001382
i have friends to discover and many things to understand,3899.5519999999997,3902.5369999999994,2.9849999999996726
one only understands the things that one tames said the fox,3903.5439999999994,3907.8279999999995,4.2840000000001055
men no longer have the time to get to know anything,3908.1719999999996,3911.2559999999994,3.0839999999998327
they buy things ready made in the shops,3911.7599999999993,3913.8189999999995,2.0590000000001965
but as there are not any shops that sell friends men no longer have any friends,3914.4019999999996,3918.8059999999996,4.403999999999996
if you want a friend tame me,3919.6039999999994,3921.7479999999996,2.144000000000233
what should i do asked the little prince,3922.9349999999995,3925.2079999999996,2.2730000000001382
you have to be very patient replied the fox,3926.1109999999994,3928.8539999999994,2.742999999999938
first you will sit down a little way away from me like this in the grass,3929.2879999999996,3933.3469999999998,4.0590000000001965
i will watch you out of the corner of my eye and you will not say anything,3933.7459999999996,3937.3989999999994,3.6529999999997926
words are a source of misunderstandings,3937.9119999999994,3940.0019999999995,2.0900000000001455
but every day you will be able to sit a little closer,3940.4909999999995,3943.6189999999997,3.1280000000001564
the next day the little prince came back,3944.9609999999993,3946.9349999999995,1.97400000000016
it would have been better to come back at the same time of day said the fox,3947.8479999999995,3951.7709999999997,3.923000000000229
if you come for example at four o clock in the afternoon from three o clock i would start to feel happy as the time got nearer,3952.0999999999995,3959.7909999999997,7.691000000000258
i would feel happier and happier already by four o clock,3959.7909999999997,3963.5239999999994,3.73299999999972
i would be jumping about and getting restless,3963.5239999999994,3965.7829999999994,2.2590000000000146
i would come to learn the price of happiness,3966.0969999999998,3968.7709999999997,2.673999999999978
but if you come at just any time i would never know at what time my heart should be ready to greet you,3969.4389999999994,3974.3869999999997,4.94800000000032
we must observe the rites,3974.8659999999995,3976.3109999999997,1.4450000000001637
what is a rite asked the little prince,3977.2729999999997,3979.432,2.1590000000001055
they are also something too often forgotten said the fox,3980.49,3983.9929999999995,3.5029999999997017
they are what make one day different from other days one hour different from other hours,3984.6659999999997,3990.0139999999997,5.347999999999956
there is a rite for example among my hunters,3990.3779999999997,3993.2769999999996,2.8989999999998872
on thursdays they dance with the girls of the village so thursday is a wonderful day,3993.7609999999995,3999.2229999999995,5.461999999999989
i can go for a walk as far as the vineyards,3999.6569999999997,4002.0769999999993,2.419999999999618
if the hunters danced on just any day all the days would be alike and i had never have any rest,4002.4159999999997,4008.3219999999997,5.905999999999949
so the little prince tamed the fox,4009.5299999999997,4011.7539999999995,2.2239999999997053
and when the time to leave drew near oh said the fox i will cry,4012.2279999999996,4017.7829999999994,5.554999999999836
it is your fault said the little prince,4018.5119999999997,4020.9569999999994,2.444999999999709
i never wished you any harm but you wanted me to tame you,4020.9569999999994,4024.6589999999997,3.7020000000002256
i know said the fox,4025.2769999999996,4026.9209999999994,1.643999999999778
but you are going to cry said the little prince,4027.5999999999995,4030.0239999999994,2.423999999999978
i know said the fox,4030.7819999999997,4032.5099999999993,1.7279999999996107
so all this has done you no good at all,4032.9439999999995,4035.5239999999994,2.5799999999999272
it has done me good said the fox,4036.2519999999995,4038.6449999999995,2.393000000000029
because of the color of the wheat,4039.0739999999996,4040.7039999999997,1.6300000000001091
and then he added go and see the roses again,4041.6359999999995,4044.8639999999996,3.2280000000000655
you will understand that yours is unique in the entire world,4045.3879999999995,4048.7169999999996,3.3290000000001783
then come back to say goodbye to me and i will make you a present of a secret,4049.3659999999995,4053.7329999999997,4.367000000000189
the little prince went away to see the roses again,4055.365,4057.8489999999997,2.4839999999999236
you are not like my rose at all,4058.8619999999996,4060.5769999999993,1.7149999999996908
you are nothing yet he told them,4060.9209999999994,4062.9499999999994,2.0289999999999964
no one has tamed you and you have not tamed anyone,4063.2389999999996,4066.3529999999996,3.1140000000000327
you are like my fox used to be,4066.6779999999994,4068.5119999999997,1.8340000000002874
he was only a fox just like a hundred thousand others but i have made him my friend and now he is unique in the entire world,4069.0699999999997,4077.4069999999997,8.336999999999989
and the roses were very embarrassed,4078.2499999999995,4080.1949999999997,1.9450000000001637
you are beautiful but you are empty he went on,4080.9629999999997,4084.2009999999996,3.237999999999829
one could not die for you,4084.5849999999996,4086.2339999999995,1.6489999999998872
of course an ordinary passer by would think that my rose looked just like you,4087.0969999999998,4091.0609999999997,3.963999999999942
but she alone is more important than all of you because it is her that i watered,4091.5799999999995,4097.072999999999,5.492999999999938
because it is her that i put under the glass dome,4097.072999999999,4099.4619999999995,2.3890000000001237
because it is her that i sheltered behind the screen,4099.945,4102.464999999999,2.519999999999527
because it is for her that i killed the caterpillars except two or three to become butterflies,4102.773999999999,4108.170999999999,5.3969999999999345
because it is her that i listened to grumble or boast or even sometimes when she said nothing,4108.7789999999995,4114.062999999999,5.283999999999651
because she is my rose,4114.630999999999,4116.215999999999,1.5850000000000364
and he went back to the fox,4117.183999999999,4118.633,1.4490000000005239
goodbye he said,4119.460999999999,4120.9,1.4390000000003056
goodbye said the fox,4121.678,4123.271,1.5929999999998472
here is my secret,4123.945,4125.009,1.0640000000003056
it is very simple,4125.343,4126.227999999999,0.8849999999993088
one only sees clearly with the heart,4127.315,4129.7789999999995,2.463999999999942
what is essential is invisible to the eye,4130.383,4133.012,2.6289999999999054
what is essential is invisible to the eye repeated the little prince so as to remember,4133.95,4138.937999999999,4.987999999999374
it is the time you have wasted on your rose that makes your rose so important,4140.021,4145.062999999999,5.041999999999462
it is the time that i have wasted on my rose said the little prince so as to remember,4145.950999999999,4150.789999999999,4.838999999999942
the men have forgotten this truth said the fox but you must not forget it,4151.772,4156.923,5.15099999999984
you become forever responsible for that which you have tamed,4157.602,4161.101,3.4989999999997963
you are responsible for your rose,4161.728999999999,4163.964,2.235000000000582
i am responsible for my rose repeated the little prince so as to remember,4164.777,4169.195,4.417999999999665
good morning said the little prince,4170.388999999999,4172.253,1.8640000000004875
good morning said the railway switchman,4172.852,4174.9259999999995,2.0739999999996144
what do you do here the little prince asked,4175.813999999999,4178.038,2.22400000000016
i sort travelers in packs of a thousand said the switchman,4178.696,4181.989,3.2929999999996653
i dispatch the trains that carry them sometimes to the right sometimes to the left,4182.508,4186.696,4.188000000000102
and a brilliantly lit express train rumbling like thunder shook the switchman 's cabin,4187.428999999999,4192.871999999999,5.443000000000211
they really are in a hurry said the little prince,4193.74,4196.419,2.6790000000000873
what is it that they are looking for,4197.123,4198.517,1.3940000000002328
not even the locomotive engineer knows that said the switchman,4199.221,4202.709,3.4880000000002838
a second brilliantly lit express thundered by in the opposite direction,4203.446999999999,4207.616,4.1690000000007785
are they back already asked the little prince,4208.459,4210.946999999999,2.4879999999993743
these are not the same ones said the switchman,4211.500999999999,4213.73,2.229000000000269
it is an exchange,4214.089,4215.143999999999,1.0549999999993815
were not they happy where they were,4215.897,4217.427,1.5299999999997453
no one is ever happy where they are said the switchman,4218.214999999999,4220.9439999999995,2.729000000000269
a third brilliantly lit express thundered by,4221.816999999999,4224.580999999999,2.7640000000001237
are they chasing after the first travelers asked the little prince,4225.468999999999,4229.047,3.5780000000004293
they are not chasing after anything at all said the switchman,4229.771,4232.718999999999,2.9479999999994106
they are asleep in there or if not they are yawning,4233.053,4235.746999999999,2.6939999999995052
only the children are Suashing their noses up against the windows,4236.295999999999,4239.615,3.3190000000004147
only the children know what they are after said the little prince,4240.4929999999995,4243.727,3.2340000000003783
they waste their time with a rag doll and it becomes very important to them,4244.026,4248.343999999999,4.3179999999993015
and if someone takes it away from them they cry,4248.838,4251.277,2.4390000000003056
they are lucky said the switchman,4252.036,4253.829,1.7929999999996653
good morning said the little prince,4253.844,4255.7029999999995,1.8589999999994689
good morning said the merchant,4256.420999999999,4258.041,1.6200000000008004
this was a merchant who sold pills that had been created to quench thirst,4258.784,4262.987,4.203000000000429
you could take one pill a week and you no longer felt the need to drink anything,4263.391,4267.53,4.139000000000124
why are you selling those asked the little prince,4268.383,4271.152,2.769000000000233
it is a big time saver said the merchant,4271.655,4274.219,2.5640000000003056
experts have done calculations,4274.219,4276.067999999999,1.8489999999992506
you save fifty three minutes per week,4276.392,4278.371,1.9790000000002692
and what do i do with the fifty three minutes,4279.344,4281.572999999999,2.2289999999993597
you can do anything you like with them,4282.231,4283.590999999999,1.3599999999996726
myself the little prince said to himself if i had fifty three minutes to spend as i liked i would walk very slowly toward a spring of fresh water,4284.733,4294.067999999999,9.334999999999127
we were at the eighth day since my accident in the desert and i had listened to the story of the merchant as i drank the last drop of my water supply,4295.223,4303.24,8.016999999999825
ah i said to the little prince these memories of yours are very charming,4304.5869999999995,4309.219999999999,4.632999999999811
but i have not managed to repair my plane yet,4309.624,4311.8589999999995,2.2349999999996726
i have nothing left to drink and i too would be happy if i could walk slowly towards a spring of fresh water,4312.352,4318.8189999999995,6.4669999999996435
my friend the fox he said to me,4319.897,4322.076,2.1790000000000873
my dear fellow our situation has nothing to do with the fox anymore,4322.639,4326.7429999999995,4.10399999999936
why not,4327.441,4328.066,0.625
because we will die of thirst,4328.744,4330.4039999999995,1.6599999999998545
he did not follow my reasoning and he answered me,4331.187,4333.741,2.5540000000000873
it is nice to have had a friend even if you are about to die,4334.42,4337.544,3.1239999999997963
myself i am glad to have had a fox as a friend,4338.297,4341.37,3.07300000000032
he never considers the danger i said to myself,4342.282999999999,4344.883,2.600000000000364
he has never been hungry or thirsty,4345.396,4347.250999999999,1.8549999999995634
a little sunshine is all he needs,4347.6449999999995,4349.525,1.8800000000001091
but he looked at me and replied to my thought,4350.317999999999,4352.4619999999995,2.144000000000233
i am also thirsty,4352.981,4354.0509999999995,1.069999999999709
let us look for a well,4354.525,4355.5,0.9750000000003638
i made a gesture of weariness,4356.4529999999995,4358.222,1.7690000000002328
it is absurd to look for a well at random in the immensity of the desert but we started walking anyway,4358.4619999999995,4364.8679999999995,6.405999999999949
when we had walked for hours in silence night fell and the stars began to come out,4366.325,4371.433,5.108000000000175
i saw them as if in a dream as my thirst had made me feverish,4371.887,4375.775,3.88799999999992
the little prince 's words danced in my memory,4376.697999999999,4379.248,2.550000000000182
so you are also thirsty i asked him,4379.861,4382.25,2.3890000000001237
but he did not reply to my question,4382.889,4384.612999999999,1.7239999999992506
he said simply water can be good for the heart too,4384.967,4388.688999999999,3.7219999999997526
i did not understand his answer but i said nothing,4389.642,4392.651,3.0090000000000146
i knew better than to press my questions,4393.174999999999,4395.294,2.1190000000005966
he was tired,4396.112,4396.7919999999995,0.6799999999993815
he sat down,4397.241,4397.971,0.7299999999995634
i sat down beside him and after a silence he spoke again,4398.634,4402.741999999999,4.107999999999265
the stars are beautiful because of a flower that can not be seen,4404.009,4407.3279999999995,3.3189999999995052
i replied that is true,4408.125999999999,4409.909,1.7830000000003565
and i looked without saying anything at the folds of sand in the moonlight,4410.612,4415.299999999999,4.687999999999192
the desert is beautiful the little prince added,4416.223,4419.016,2.7929999999996653
and it was true,4419.8589999999995,4420.648999999999,0.7899999999999636
i have always loved the desert,4421.003,4422.512,1.5090000000000146
you sit down on a sand dune,4423.41,4424.98,1.569999999999709
you see nothing,4425.349,4426.159,0.8099999999994907
you hear nothing and yet something radiates forth in the silence,4426.638,4431.69,5.05199999999968
what makes the desert beautiful said the little prince is that somewhere it hides a well,4432.9169999999995,4438.737999999999,5.820999999999913
i was surprised to suddenly understand this mysterious radiation of the sands,4440.315,4445.089,4.774000000000342
when i was a little boy i lived in an old house and legend told that a treasure was buried there,4446.236,4452.228999999999,5.992999999999483
of course no one had ever been able to find it or perhaps no one had even looked for it,4452.652999999999,4458.009999999999,5.356999999999971
but it cast an enchantment over that house,4458.518999999999,4461.482,2.9630000000006476
my home was hiding a secret in the depths of its heart,4461.936,4465.349999999999,3.41399999999976
yes i said to the little prince,4466.197999999999,4468.227,2.029000000000451
whether the house the stars or the desert what gives them their beauty is something invisible,4469.009999999999,4474.5019999999995,5.492000000000189
i am glad he said that you agree with my fox,4475.594,4478.612999999999,3.0189999999993233
as the little prince fell asleep i took him in my arms and set out walking again,4480.188999999999,4484.782999999999,4.594000000000051
i felt deeply moved,4485.486,4486.969999999999,1.4839999999994689
it seemed to me that i was carrying a very fragile treasure,4487.4439999999995,4491.178,3.7340000000003783
it even seemed to me that there was nothing more fragile on earth,4491.652,4495.411,3.7590000000000146
i looked in the moonlight at his pale forehead his closed eyes his locks of hair that trembled in the wind,4496.612999999999,4503.424999999999,6.811999999999898
and i said to myself what i see here is only a shell,4503.924,4507.9169999999995,3.9929999999994834
that which is most important is invisible,4508.53,4510.815,2.2849999999998545
as his slightly parted lips gave way to a half smile i continued what i find so deeply moving about this little sleeping prince is his devotion to a flower,4512.036999999999,4522.9259999999995,10.889000000000124
it is the image of a rose that shines in him like the flame of a lamp even when he is sleeping,4523.768999999999,4528.871999999999,5.1030000000000655
and i came to think of him as even more fragile,4529.79,4532.455,2.6649999999999636
one has to look after lamps,4533.781999999999,4535.576,1.7940000000007785
a gust of wind can put them out,4535.945,4537.824,1.8789999999999054
and continuing to walk i found the well at daybreak,4538.608,4542.281,3.6729999999997744
men said the little prince stuff themselves into express trains but they do not know what they are looking for,4543.505,4550.061,6.555999999999585
so they rush about and go in circles and he added it is not worth it,4550.37,4555.616,5.246000000000095
the well we had reached was not like the other wells of the sahara,4557.197999999999,4560.557,3.3590000000003783
the wells of the sahara are mere holes dug in the sand,4561.304999999999,4564.789,3.4840000000003783
this one looked like a village well but there was no village there and i thought i was dreaming,4565.134,4571.014,5.880000000000109
it is strange i said to the little prince,4571.987,4574.311,2.3239999999996144
everything has been prepared the pulley the bucket and the rope,4574.724999999999,4578.178,3.4530000000004293
he laughed took the rope and put the pulley to work,4578.672,4582.009,3.337000000000444
and the pulley moaned like an old weathervane when there has long been no wind,4582.576999999999,4587.165999999999,4.588999999999942
can you hear that said the little prince,4587.994,4590.197999999999,2.2039999999997235
we have woken up the well and it is singing,4590.487,4592.715999999999,2.2289999999993597
i did not want him to tire himself out,4593.558999999999,4595.589,2.030000000000655
let me do it i said,4596.121999999999,4597.467,1.3450000000002547
it is too heavy for you,4597.790999999999,4598.781,0.9900000000006912
i hoisted the bucket slowly to the edge of the well and set it down good and level,4599.803,4604.5019999999995,4.698999999999614
the song of the pulley continued in my ears and in the still trembling water i could see the sunlight shimmer,4605.105,4611.893,6.788000000000466
i am thirsty for this water said the little prince,4612.87,4615.499,2.6289999999999054
give me some to drink,4616.018,4617.088,1.069999999999709
and i knew then what he had been looking for,4618.049999999999,4620.2699999999995,2.2200000000002547
i raised the bucket to his lips,4620.963,4623.022,2.0590000000001965
he drank,4623.366,4624.141,0.7749999999996362
his eyes closed,4624.141,4625.49,1.34900000000016
it was as sweet as some special festival treat,4625.844,4628.963,3.118999999999687
this water was something very different from ordinary nourishment,4629.835999999999,4633.634999999999,3.798999999999978
it was born of the walk under the stars of the song of the pulley of the effort of my arms,4634.129,4639.616,5.48700000000008
it was good for the heart like a present,4640.16,4642.563,2.4030000000002474
when i was a little boy the lights of the christmas tree the music of the midnight mass the tenderness in the smiles produced in a similar way the radiance of the gift that i received,4643.3769999999995,4655.0599999999995,11.682999999999993
the men where you live said the little prince grow five thousand roses in a single garden and they do not find what they are looking for in it,4656.281999999999,4664.893,8.611000000000786
they do not find it i replied,4665.611,4667.44,1.8289999999997235
and yet what they are looking for could be found in a single rose or in a little water,4668.027999999999,4673.514999999999,5.48700000000008
that is true i said,4674.353999999999,4675.763,1.4090000000005602
and the little prince added but the eyes are blind,4676.590999999999,4679.834,3.243000000000393
you have to search with the heart,4680.1179999999995,4681.7519999999995,1.6340000000000146
i had drunk the water,4683.119,4684.268999999999,1.1499999999996362
i breathed easily,4684.797,4685.897,1.1000000000003638
the sand at sunrise is the color of honey,4686.545999999999,4689.11,2.5640000000003056
this honey color was also making me feel good,4689.648999999999,4692.777999999999,3.1289999999999054
why then did i have to have this sense of grief,4693.596,4696.505,2.9090000000005602
you have to keep your promise said the little prince softly who had again sat down beside me,4697.656999999999,4703.389,5.73200000000088
what promise,4704.517,4705.267,0.75
you know a muzzle for my sheep,4705.88,4708.063999999999,2.183999999999287
i am responsible for this flower,4708.867,4710.585999999999,1.7189999999991414
i took my sketches out of my pocket,4711.958,4714.052,2.094000000000051
the little prince saw them and laughed as he said your baobabs they look a bit like cabbages,4714.516,4720.652,6.136000000000422
oh and i had been so proud of my baobabs,4721.306,4724.548,3.242000000000189
your fox his ears they look a bit like horns and they are too long,4725.371,4730.114,4.742999999999483
and then he laughed again,4730.746999999999,4732.031999999999,1.2849999999998545
you are not being fair my little fellow,4732.759999999999,4734.594999999999,1.8350000000000364
i do not know how to draw anything except boa constrictors closed and open,4734.999,4739.347,4.347999999999956
oh it will be ok he said,4740.2699999999995,4742.169,1.899000000000342
children understand,4742.478,4743.612999999999,1.1349999999993088
so i made a pencil sketch of a muzzle and i felt a pang in my heart as i gave it to him,4744.71,4750.173,5.462999999999738
you have plans that i do not know about,4751.19,4753.11,1.9200000000000728
but he did not respond,4754.013,4755.182,1.168999999999869
he said to me you know my descent to earth tomorrow will be its anniversary,4755.736,4761.985,6.248999999999796
then after a silence he went on,4763.187,4765.172,1.9849999999996726
i came down very near here,4766.0599999999995,4767.795,1.735000000000582
and he blushed,4768.612999999999,4769.393,0.7800000000006548
and once again without understanding why i felt a peculiar sense of sorrow one question occurred to me however,4770.474999999999,4778.596,8.121000000000095
so it was not by chance that the morning i first met you a week ago,4779.409,4783.697999999999,4.28899999999976
you were out walking like that all alone a thousand miles from any inhabited region,4784.1269999999995,4789.385,5.25800000000072
you were going back to the place where you landed,4790.112999999999,4792.277,2.1640000000006694
the little prince blushed again,4793.375,4795.0289999999995,1.6539999999995416
and i added hesitantly perhaps because of the anniversary,4795.5779999999995,4799.75,4.17200000000048
the little prince blushed once more,4801.047,4803.017,1.9700000000002547
he never answered questions but when you blush that means yes,4803.581,4807.789,4.207999999999629
does not it,4807.789,4808.338,0.5489999999999782
oh i said to him,4809.3949999999995,4810.75,1.355000000000473
i am worried,4811.214,4811.909,0.694999999999709
but he responded now you must work,4812.353,4815.04,2.686999999999898
you must go back to your engine,4815.659,4817.1939999999995,1.5349999999998545
i will wait for you here,4817.637,4818.807,1.1700000000000728
come back tomorrow evening,4819.210999999999,4820.5509999999995,1.3400000000001455
but i was not reassured,4821.539,4822.822999999999,1.2839999999996508
i remembered the fox,4823.482,4824.806,1.3239999999996144
you run the risk of weeping a little if you allow yourself to be tamed,4825.478999999999,4829.553,4.074000000000524
there was next to the well the ruin of an old stone wall,4829.943,4834.107,4.16399999999976
when i came back from my work the next evening i saw from a distance my little prince sitting on top of it,4835.015,4841.2519999999995,6.2369999999991705
his feet hanging down,4841.576,4842.971,1.394999999999527
and i heard him say do not you remember,4843.614,4846.108,2.4940000000005966
then this is not the exact spot,4846.108,4848.521,2.412999999999556
another voice must have answered him because he replied yes yes it is the right day but this is not the right place,4849.273999999999,4856.73,7.456000000000131
i continued my walk toward the wall,4857.9619999999995,4859.942,1.980000000000473
i still did not see or hear anyone yet,4860.536,4863.201,2.6649999999999636
the little prince replied again that is right,4863.201,4866.137,2.9359999999996944
you will see where my tracks begin in the sand,4866.481,4868.626,2.1450000000004366
you just have to wait there for me,4869.025,4870.809,1.7840000000005602
i will be there tonight,4871.143,4872.228,1.0850000000000364
i was twenty meters from the wall and i still saw nothing,4873.256,4876.765,3.5090000000000146
the little prince spoke again after a pause,4877.558,4879.897,2.338999999999942
do you have good poison,4880.59,4881.965,1.375
are you sure you will not make me suffer too long,4882.668,4884.9929999999995,2.324999999999818
i froze,4885.9,4886.599999999999,0.6999999999998181
my heart skipped a beat but i still did not understand,4887.144,4890.821,3.67699999999968
now go away he said,4891.8189999999995,4893.553,1.7340000000003783
i want to come down from here,4894.022,4895.397,1.375
i then lowered my eyes to the foot of the wall and i leapt up,4896.574,4900.492,3.918000000000575
right there facing the little prince was one of those yellow snakes that can kill you in thirty seconds flat,4900.956,4907.864,6.907999999999447
even as i dug around in my pocket to take out my revolver i made a running step back,4908.498,4914.329,5.831000000000131
but at the noise i made the snake let himself flow easily across the sand like the dying spray of a fountain and in no apparent hurry slipped between the stones with a light metallic sound,4915.103,4927.821,12.717999999999847
i reached the wall just in time to catch my little fellow in my arms who was white as snow,4928.689,4934.057,5.367999999999483
what is going on here,4934.849999999999,4935.75,0.9000000000005457
why are you talking with snakes,4935.95,4937.7339999999995,1.7839999999996508
i had loosened the golden muffler that he always wore,4938.702,4941.416,2.713999999999942
i had moistened his temples and had him drink,4941.89,4944.315,2.4249999999992724
and now i did not dare ask him anything more,4944.704,4947.652,2.94800000000032
he looked at me gravely and put his arms around my neck,4948.485,4951.424,2.9390000000003056
i felt his heart beat like the heart of a dying bird when shot with a rifle,4951.983,4956.4259999999995,4.4429999999993015
he said to me i am glad that you have found what was wrong with your engine,4957.04,4960.823,3.7830000000003565
now you will be able to go back home,4961.291,4963.001,1.7100000000000364
how did you know,4963.674,4964.394,0.7200000000002547
i was just coming to tell him that against all odds my work had been successful,4965.113,4969.586,4.472999999999956
he made no answer to my question but he added i am also going back home today,4970.419,4975.651,5.231999999999971
then he said sadly it is a lot further,4976.469,4979.307,2.837999999999738
it is much more difficult,4979.731,4981.146,1.4149999999999636
i felt very clearly that something extraordinary was happening,4982.407999999999,4985.927,3.519000000000233
i held him tightly in my arms like a small child,4986.675,4989.72,3.0450000000000728
and yet it seemed to me that he was plummeting down into an abyss and that i could do nothing to restrain him,4989.9839999999995,4995.941,5.957000000000335
he had a serious look as if lost far away,4997.139,5000.258,3.118999999999687
i have your sheep and i have the box for the sheep and i have the muzzle,5001.19,5006.032,4.842000000000553
and he smiled sadly,5006.8,5008.164,1.363999999999578
i waited a long while,5009.287,5010.767,1.4799999999995634
i could feel that he was reviving little by little,5011.36,5013.97,2.610000000000582
my little fellow i said to him,5014.833,5016.687,1.8540000000002692
you are afraid,5017.181,5017.995,0.8140000000003056
he was afraid of course but he laughed softly,5018.873,5021.906,3.0330000000003565
i will be much more afraid this evening,5022.68,5024.539,1.8589999999994689
again i felt myself frozen by the sense of something irreparable and i knew that i could not bear the idea of never hearing that laughter again,5025.5419999999995,5035.472,9.930000000000291
for me it was like a spring of fresh water in the desert,5036.42,5040.068,3.6480000000001382
little fellow i said i want to hear you laugh again,5041.191,5044.863,3.67200000000048
but he said to me tonight it will be a year,5045.776,5048.789,3.01299999999992
my star will be right above the spot where i came down to earth a year ago,5049.372,5053.471,4.098999999999251
little fellow is this all a bad dream this business with the snake and the meeting place and the star,5054.583,5060.625,6.042000000000371
but he did not answer my question,5061.548,5063.083,1.5349999999998545
he said to me that which is important can not be seen,5063.995,5067.882,3.8869999999997162
i know,5068.69,5069.12,0.43000000000029104
it is like with the flower,5070.023,5071.318,1.2950000000000728
if you love a flower that is on a star it is sweet to look at the sky at night,5071.841,5076.514,4.6729999999997744
all the stars are covered with flowers,5077.093,5079.197,2.104000000000269
i know,5080.055,5080.476,0.420999999999367
it is like with the water,5081.309,5082.543,1.2339999999994689
the water you gave me to drink was like music because of the pulley and the rope,5082.8769999999995,5087.485,4.608000000000175
you remember,5088.004,5088.714,0.7100000000000364
it was good,5089.277,5089.907,0.6300000000001091
i know,5090.9,5091.36,0.4600000000000364
at night you will look at the stars,5092.412,5094.1269999999995,1.714999999999236
where i live everything is too small for me to point out to you where my star is,5094.456,5099.369,4.912999999999556
it is better like that,5099.848,5101.007,1.1589999999996508
my star will be for you just one of the stars,5101.396,5104.48,3.0839999999998327
so you will love to look at all of the stars,5104.999,5107.233,2.2340000000003783
they will all be your friends,5107.677,5108.9619999999995,1.2849999999998545
and besides i am going to make you a present,5109.45,5112.273999999999,2.8239999999996144
he laughed again,5113.077,5114.081,1.0039999999999054
ah little fellow dear little fellow i love to hear that laugh,5115.004,5119.247,4.243000000000393
that is my present,5120.2,5121.273999999999,1.0739999999996144
just that it will be like with the water,5121.713,5124.611,2.8980000000001382
what are you trying to say,5125.663,5126.773,1.110000000000582
everyone has the same stars but they are not the same to everyone,5128.04,5132.443,4.403000000000247
for some who are travelers the stars are guides,5133.326,5136.43,3.104000000000269
for others they are nothing but little lights,5137.023999999999,5139.702,2.678000000000793
for others who are scholars they are problems,5140.495,5142.889999999999,2.394999999999527
for my businessman they were wealth,5143.394,5145.258,1.863999999999578
but none of these stars say anything back,5146.017,5148.461,2.4440000000004147
you will have the stars as no one else has them,5149.519,5152.423,2.9039999999995416
what are you trying to say,5153.436,5154.531,1.0950000000002547
when you look at the sky at night because i will be living on one of them because i will be laughing on one of them for you it will be like all the stars are laughing,5156.057,5166.556,10.498999999999796
you only you will have stars that can laugh,5167.15,5171.017,3.867000000000189
and he laughed again,5171.86,5173.03,1.1700000000000728
and when your sorrow is comforted time heals all wounds you will be glad to have known me,5174.327,5179.974,5.6469999999999345
you will always be my friend,5180.692,5182.1269999999995,1.4349999999994907
you will want to laugh with me,5182.541,5184.115,1.5739999999996144
and sometimes you will open your window just like that for fun,5184.594,5188.3769999999995,3.782999999999447
and your friends will be very surprised to see you laughing whilst watching the sky,5188.901,5193.375,4.47400000000016
so you will tell them yes the stars always make me laugh and they will think you are crazy,5194.138,5200.144,6.006000000000313
i will have played a dirty trick on you,5200.638,5202.522,1.8840000000000146
and he laughed again,5203.32,5204.43,1.110000000000582
it will be as if i would given you instead of stars lots and lots of little bells that can laugh,5205.478,5211.3099999999995,5.831999999999425
and he laughed some more,5211.964,5213.213,1.2489999999997963
then he suddenly became serious again,5214.471,5216.885,2.4140000000006694
tonight you know do not come,5218.003,5220.9439999999995,2.9409999999998035
i will not leave you,5221.952,5222.786,0.8339999999998327
it will look as if i am suffering,5223.879,5225.623,1.7439999999996871
it will look a bit as if i am dying,5226.237,5228.056,1.8189999999995052
it is like that,5228.49,5229.36,0.8699999999998909
do not come to see that,5230.008,5231.282999999999,1.2749999999996362
it is not worth it,5231.567,5232.5419999999995,0.9749999999994543
i will not leave you,5233.544,5234.479,0.9350000000004002
but he was worried,5235.4619999999995,5236.332,0.8700000000008004
i am telling you this it is also because of the snake,5237.324,5240.563,3.2390000000004875
he must not bite you,5241.012,5242.401,1.3890000000001237
snakes are mean,5243.0199999999995,5244.045,1.0250000000005457
they can bite you just for fun,5244.449,5246.123,1.6739999999999782
i will not leave you,5247.206,5248.266,1.0599999999994907
but something reassured him,5249.268,5250.733,1.4650000000001455
it is true that they have no poison left for a second bite,5251.995,5255.273999999999,3.2789999999995416
that night i did not see him set out,5256.232,5258.596,2.363999999999578
he got away without making a sound,5259.13,5261.044,1.91399999999976
when i managed to catch him up he was walking along determinedly at a brisk pace,5261.912,5267.014999999999,5.102999999999156
he said to me only oh you came,5267.7029999999995,5270.811,3.1080000000001746
and he took me by the hand but he was still worrying,5271.619,5274.847,3.2280000000000655
you have made a mistake,5276.129,5277.157999999999,1.0289999999995416
you will suffer,5277.602,5278.2519999999995,0.6499999999996362
it will look as if i am dead and that will not be true,5278.736,5281.585,2.84900000000016
i said nothing,5282.448,5283.257,0.808999999999287
you understand it is too far,5284.2699999999995,5286.503,2.2330000000001746
i can not carry this body with me,5287.062,5288.8769999999995,1.8149999999995998
it is too heavy,5288.8769999999995,5289.7609999999995,0.8840000000000146
i said nothing,5290.9439999999995,5291.758,0.8140000000003056
but it will be like an old abandoned shell,5293.275,5295.54,2.2650000000003274
there is nothing sad about old shells,5296.013,5298.108,2.0950000000002547
i said nothing,5299.255,5300.045,0.7899999999999636
he got a bit discouraged but he made one more effort,5301.093,5304.281,3.188000000000102
you know it will be nice,5305.064,5306.963,1.8989999999994325
i will also look at the stars,5307.597,5309.241,1.6440000000002328
all the stars will be wells with a rusty pulley,5309.815,5312.684,2.8690000000005966
all the stars will pour out fresh water for me to drink,5313.043,5316.402,3.3590000000003783
i said nothing,5317.659,5318.534,0.875
it will be so much fun,5319.696,5321.031,1.3350000000000364
you will have five hundred million little bells and i will have five hundred million springs of fresh water,5321.63,5327.973,6.342999999999847
and then he too was silent because he was crying,5329.28,5332.273999999999,2.993999999999687
here is the place,5333.691,5334.47,0.7790000000004511
let me go on by myself,5335.139,5336.629,1.4899999999997817
and he sat down because he was afraid,5337.536,5339.551,2.0150000000003274
he said you know my flower i am responsible for her,5340.449,5345.204,4.755000000000109
and she is so weak,5345.7919999999995,5346.957,1.1650000000008731
and she is so naive,5347.411,5348.701,1.2899999999999636
she has four thorns of no use at all to protect herself against the entire world,5349.499,5354.977,5.4780000000000655
i sat down too because i was no longer able to stand,5356.313,5360.032,3.719000000000051
he said that is everything,5361.103999999999,5364.45,3.3460000000004584
he hesitated a bit and then stood back up,5365.767,5368.57,2.8029999999998836
he took one step,5369.507,5370.537,1.0300000000006548
i could not move,5371.255,5372.165,0.9099999999998545
there was nothing but a yellow flash close to his ankle,5373.182,5376.412,3.230000000000473
he remained motionless for an instant,5377.219999999999,5379.5689999999995,2.34900000000016
he did not cry out,5380.198,5381.332,1.1340000000000146
he fell as gently as a tree falls,5382.056,5384.385,2.329000000000633
there was not even any sound because of the sand,5385.019,5387.878,2.858999999999469
and now of course it has already been six years,5389.118,5392.222,3.1039999999993597
i have never yet told this story,5392.775,5394.795,2.0200000000004366
the companions who met me were very happy to see me alive again,5395.633,5399.0869999999995,3.4539999999997235
i was sad but i told them it is because i am tired,5399.746,5402.939,3.193000000000211
now my sorrow is comforted a little,5404.191,5406.351,2.1599999999998545
i mean not entirely but i do know that he got back to his planet because at daybreak i did not find his body,5406.745,5414.295,7.550000000000182
it was not a very heavy body,5415.207,5416.897,1.6899999999995998
and i love to listen to the stars at night,5417.471,5419.745,2.274000000000342
it is just like five hundred million little bells,5420.364,5423.3279999999995,2.963999999999942
but there is one extraordinary thing,5424.371,5426.585,2.213999999999942
when i drew the muzzle for the little prince i forgot to add the leather strap to it,5427.4529999999995,5432.415,4.962000000000444
he would never have been able to fasten it to the sheep,5433.023999999999,5435.643,2.6190000000005966
so i wonder what happened on his planet,5436.216,5438.965,2.7489999999997963
it may well be the sheep ate the flower,5439.683,5441.752,2.0690000000004147
sometimes i tell myself surely not the little prince shuts his flower under her glass dome every night and he watches over his sheep very carefully,5442.78,5452.085,9.305000000000291
then i am happy and all the stars laugh sweetly,5452.6539999999995,5455.832,3.178000000000793
other times i tell myself everyone is absent minded at some point and that is all it takes,5456.745,5462.677,5.931999999999789
one evening he would have forgotten the glass dome or maybe the sheep got out quietly during the night,5462.951,5468.9529999999995,6.001999999999498
and then the little bells turn to tears,5469.731,5472.130999999999,2.399999999999636
herein lies a great mystery for you who also love the little prince just like for me,5473.348,5479.559,6.21100000000024
nothing in the universe is the same if somewhere out there a sheep that we have never seen has has it eaten a rose,5480.058,5489.456,9.398000000000138
look at the sky,5490.644,5491.463,0.8189999999995052
ask yourselves has the sheep yes or no eaten the flower,5492.1269999999995,5496.868,4.741000000000895
and you will see how everything changes,5497.771,5499.8009999999995,2.0299999999997453
and no grownup will ever understand that this is a matter of such importance,5500.519,5505.387,4.867999999999483
this to me is the most beautiful and most sad landscape in the world,5507.133,5512.021,4.88799999999992
it is the same landscape as the one on the previous page,5512.804,5515.859,3.055000000000291
but i have drawn it again to show it to you properly,5516.437,5518.922,2.4849999999996726
it is here that the little prince appeared on earth and then disappeared,5519.69,5523.852,4.162000000000262
look at this landscape carefully so as to be sure to recognize it if one day you travel in africa in the desert,5524.785,5532.216,7.431000000000495
and if you happen to pass by there i beg you do not hurry on,5532.78,5537.257,4.476999999999862
wait a while exactly under the star,5537.796,5539.96,2.16399999999976
if a child then comes to you if he laughs if he has golden hair if he does not respond when questioned you will easily guess who it is,5540.678,5550.412,9.734000000000378
so think of me,5550.971,5551.791,0.8200000000006185
save me from this sorrow,5552.32,5553.73,1.4099999999998545
write to me quickly to tell me he is back,5554.253,5556.5869999999995,2.3339999999998327
